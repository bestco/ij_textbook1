\textbf{Aim: students acquire basic knowledge and techniques for handling
digital image data by interactively using ImageJ.} \\
\\

NOTE: this textbook was written using ImageJ ver 1.44g (JRE 1.6.0\_15).
Exercises are recommended to be done using Fiji since most of
plugins used in exercises are pre-installed in Fiji. 

Many texts, images
and exercises especially for chapter 1.3 and 1.4 were converted from
Matlab Image Processing Course in MBL, Woods Hall (and many of these are
originally from a book \textit{Digital Image Processing
using Matlab}, Gonzalez et al, Prentice Hall). I
thank Ivan Yudushkin for providing me with the manual he used there. 

This text
is progressively edited. Please ask me when you want to distribute. \\
