	Abstract = {The analysis of instantaneous and average rolling leukocyte velocity
	is crucial to the study of inflammatory disease. In order to record
	features associated with leukocyte rolling, the leukocyte position
	must be tracked, typically by manual observation. Automated tracking
	of leukocytes is possible for in vitro studies, but not for recordings
	resulting from intravital experiments. Therefore, we have designed
	and implemented an image processing system for automated tracking
	of rolling leukocytes in vivo. The novel image processing techniques
	used in the tracking system successfully address the four major problems
	associated with tracking cells in vivo: background movement, severe
	image noise and clutter, cell deformation and contrast change, and
	occlusion of the target cell by other structures. We have tested
	the system in two experimental protocols in which leukocyte rolling
	is observed in venules of the mouse cremaster muscle with and without
	TNF-alpha treatment. The automated tracking system was validated
	by comparing automatically generated displacement and velocity data
	with data from the same recordings collected manually. The root mean
	squared error between the computed displacements and the manually
	measured displacements was less than 12% of the average displacement
	in TNF-alpha-treated venules. The average velocity error was also
	less than 12%. For untreated venules, the computed and measured displacements
	and velocities had an RMSE of less than 8%. The automated tracking
	system allows one, for the first time, to reliably track rolling
	leukocytes in vivo, thus eliminating possible investigator bias and
	increasing throughput.},

@article{Anand2003,
	Abstract = {Experimental measurements of velocity and tracer gas concentration
	are taken in a straight tube to evaluate the effectiveness of mixing
	in achieving conditions as required by ANSI N13.1-1999 for single
	point extractive sampling from stacks and ducts of nuclear facilities.
	Mixing is evaluated for inlet turbulent intensities of 1.5%, 10%,
	and 20%, achieved by introducing various bi-plane grids, and for
	conditions generated by a commercial static gas mixer. The data obtained
	(at Reynolds number = 15,000) highlight the importance of inlet turbulence
	intensity in the process of turbulent dispersion of a dilute gas.
	The gas mixer does not introduce significant pressure losses and
	unlike bi-plane grids, the turbulence downstream of the mixer is
	not homogenous. A judicious choice of the release location that uses
	the large scale eddies and inhomogeneity of the turbulence ensures
	that the specified ANSI N13.1-1999 criteria are attained within 7
	diameters downstream of the duct inlet. This is significantly more
	effective than a bi-plane grid where even with 20% inlet intensity
	the criteria are met only at 21 diameters downstream. The predictions
	of a proposed semi-empirical correlation match favorably with data.
	For example, at 18 diameters downstream with inlet intensities of
	1.5% and 10%, the predicted coefficients of variation (COVs) of 150%
	and 65% are close to the actual values of 154% and 50%; where the
	COV of a set of measurements is the ratio of the standard deviation
	of the set to its mean value. The corresponding results obtained
	using commercially available software are 141% and 12%. Results from
	a particle-tracking model show good qualitative trends, but they
	should not be used to determine compliance with the requirements
	of the ANSI standard.},

@article{cmaderson1992,
	Abstract = {A fluorescence imaging system, based on using a cooled slow-scan CCD
	camera, has been developed for tracking receptors on the surfaces
	of living cells. The technique is applicable to receptors for particles
	such as lipoproteins and viruses that can be labeled with a few tens
	of fluorophores. The positions of single particles in each image
	are determined to within 25 nm by fitting the fluorescence distribution
	to a two-dimensional Gaussian function. This procedure also provides
	an accurate measure of intensity, which is used as a tag for automated
	tracking of particles from frame to frame. The method is applied
	to an investigation of the mobility of receptors for LDL and influenza
	virus particles on human dermal fibroblasts at 4 degrees C. In contrast
	to previous studies by FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching),
	it is found that receptors have a low but measurable mobility at
	4 degrees C. Analysis of individual particle tracks indicates that
	whilst some receptors undergo random diffusion, others undergo directed
	motion (flow) or diffusion restricted to a domain. A procedure is
	proposed for subdividing receptors according to their different types
	of motion and hence determining their motional parameters. The finding
	that receptors are not completely immobilised at 4 degrees C is significant
	for studies of receptor distributions performed at this temperature.},

@article{Apgar2000BJ.pdf,
	Abstract = {One of the central functions of actin cytoskeleton is to provide the
	mechanical support required for the establishment and maintenance
	of cell morphology. The mechanical properties of actin filament assemblies
	are a consequence of both the available polymer concentration and
	the actin regulatory proteins that direct the formation of higher
	order structures. By monitoring the displacement of well-dispersed
	microspheres via fluorescence microscopy, we probe the degree of
	spatial heterogeneity of F-actin gels and networks in vitro. We compare
	the distribution of the time-dependent mean-square displacement (MSD)
	of polystyrene microspheres imbedded in low- and high-concentration
	F-actin solutions, in the presence and absence of the F-actin-bundling
	protein fascin. The MSD distribution of a 2. 6-microM F-actin solution
	is symmetric and its standard deviation is similar to that of a homogeneous
	solution of glycerol of similar zero-shear viscosity. However, increasing
	actin concentration renders the MSD distribution wide and asymmetric,
	an effect enhanced by fascin. Quantitative changes in the shape of
	the MSD distribution correlate qualitatively with the presence of
	large heterogeneities in F-actin solutions produced by increased
	filament concentration and the presence of actin bundles, as detected
	by confocal microscopy. Multiple-particle tracking offers a new,
	quantitative method to characterize the organization of biopolymers
	in solution.},

@article{Arnheiter1984,
	Abstract = {We have prepared polyclonal antibodies to the cytoplasmic portion
	of the envelope glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
	by using synthetic peptides corresponding to either the 22 or 11
	ultimate carboxy-terminal residues of the G as immunogens. When antibodies
	to the 22 residue peptide are microinjected into monolayer baby hamster
	kidney cells before or shortly after infection with wild-type VSV,
	G protein accumulates in large intracellular patches and little G
	is observed in the Golgi complex or at the cell surface. In contrast,
	when antibodies to the 11 residue peptide are injected, no such patches
	are observed and G protein is seen colocalized with the injected
	antibody at the endoplasmic reticulum, in the Golgi complex, in transport
	vesicles, and at the plasma membrane. Microinjection of these antibodies
	does not disturb the pathway or kinetics of G-protein transport.
	In cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of VSV, 045,
	the glycoprotein accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum at 39.8
	degrees C, but rapidly moves through the Golgi apparatus and then
	to the cell surface after a temperature shift-down to 32 degrees
	C. Using rhodamine-coupled antibodies to the 11 residue peptide,
	a microscope stage equipped for precise temperature control, and
	a silicon intensifier target video camera, we can visualize by video
	light microscopy the synchronized exocytotic transport of the G protein
	directly in the living cell.},

@article{Awasthi1994,
	Abstract = {We have developed and tested an automated method for simultaneous
	3-D tracking of numerous, fluorescently-tagged cells. The procedure
	uses multiple thresholding to segment individual cells at a starting
	timepoint, and then iteratively applies a template-matching algorithm
	to locate a particular cell's position at subsequent timepoints.
	To speed up the method, we have developed a distributed implementation
	in which template matching is carried out in parallel on several
	different server machines. The distributed implementation showed
	a monotonic decrease in response time with increasing number of servers
	(up to 15 tested), demonstrating that the tracking algorithm is well
	suited to parallelization, and that nearly real-time performance
	could be expected on a parallel processor. Of four different template
	matching statistics tested for 3-D tracking of amoebae from the cellular
	slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum, we found that the automated
	procedure performed best when using a correlation statistic for matching.
	Using this statistic, the method achieved a 98.5% success rate in
	correctly identifying a cell from one time point to the next. This
	method is now being used regularly for 3-D tracking of normal and
	mutant cells of D. discoideum, and as such provides a means to quantify
	the motion of many cells within a three-dimensional tissue mass.},

	Abstract = {Fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR) denotes a method for measuring
	two-dimensional lateral mobility of fluorescent particles, for example,
	the motion of fluorescently labeled molecules in approximately 10
	mum2 regions of a single cell surface. A small spot on the fluorescent
	surface is photobleached by a brief exposure to an intense focused

	Information obtainable from FPR experiments includes: (a) identification
	of transport process type, i.e. the admixture of random diffusion
	and uniform directed flow; (b) determination of the absolute mobility

	microm in diameter) were used to determine the local viscoelastic
	moduli. Step-force pulses were applied to the magnetic beads and
	the displacement was observed by single particle tracking. By analyzing
	the creep response curves in terms of a triphasic mechanical equivalent
	circuit, we measured the shear elastic modulus, the effective viscosities,
	and the strain relaxation time. The values of the shear modulus vary
	by more than an order of magnitude within the cell population (range,

	The effective viscosity of the cytoplasm exhibits a relatively sharp

	measured the displacement field generated by the local forces by
	observing the induced motion of nonmagnetic beads. Even at distances

	Abstract = {We have shown previously that intracellular phagosome movement requires
	microtubules. Here we provide evidence that within cells phagosomes
	display two different kinds of microtubule-based movements in approximately
	equal proportions. The first type occurs predominantly in the cell
	periphery, often shortly after the phagosome is formed, and at speeds
	below 0.1 microm/second. The second is faster (0.2-1.5 micron/second)
	and occurs mainly after phagosomes have reached the cell interior.
	Treating cells with nanomolar concentrations of taxol or nocodazole
	alters microtubule dynamics without affecting either total polymer
	mass or microtubule organisation. Such treatments slow the accumulation
	of phagosomes in the perinuclear region and reduce the number of
	slow movements by up to 50% without affecting the frequency of fast
	movements. This suggests that a proportion of slow movements are
	mediated by microtubule dynamics while fast movements are powered
	by microtubule motors. In macrophages, interphase microtubules radiate
	from the microtubule organising centre with their plus-end towards
	the cell periphery. To understand the behaviour of 'early' phagosomes
	at the cell periphery we investigated their ability to bind microtubule
	plus-ends in vitro. We show that early phagosomes have a strong preference
	for microtubule plus-ends, whereas 'late' phagosomes do not, and
	that plus-end affinity requires the presence of microtubule-associated
	proteins within cytosol. We suggest that phagosomes can bind to the
	plus-ends of dynamic microtubules and move by following their shrinkage
	or growth.},

	Abstract = {Microtubules facilitate the maturation of phagosomes by favoring their
	interactions with endocytic compartments. Here, we show that phagosomes
	move within cells along tracks of several microns centrifugally and
	centripetally in a pH- and microtubule-dependent manner. Phagosome
	movement was reconstituted in vitro and required energy, cytosol
	and membrane proteins of this organelle. The activity or presence
	of these phagosome proteins was regulated as the organelle matured,
	with "late" phagosomes moving threefold more frequently than "early"
	ones. The majority of moving phagosomes were minus-end directed;
	the remainder moved towards microtubule plus-ends and a small subset
	moved bi-directionally. Minus-end movement showed pharmacological
	characteristics expected for dyneins, was inhibited by immunodepletion
	of cytoplasmic dynein and could be restored by addition of cytoplasmic
	dynein. Plus-end movement displayed pharmacological properties of
	kinesin, was inhibited partially by immunodepletion of kinesin and
	fully by addition of an anti-kinesin IgG. Immunodepletion of dynactin,
	a dynein-activating complex, inhibited only minus-end directed motility.
	Evidence is provided for a dynactin-associated kinase required for
	dynein-mediated vesicle transport. Movement in both directions was
	inhibited by peptide fragments from kinectin (a putative kinesin
	membrane receptor), derived from the region to which a motility-blocking
	antibody binds. Polypeptide subunits from these microtubule-based
	motility factors were detected on phagosomes by immunoblotting or
	immunoelectron microscopy. This is the first study using a single
	in vitro system that describes the roles played by kinesin, kinectin,
	cytoplasmic dynein, and dynactin in the microtubule-mediated movement

	Abstract = {In macrophages, phagosome movement is microtubule-dependent. Microtubules
	are a prerequisite for phagosome maturation because they facilitate

	We have established an in vitro assay that measures the binding of
	purified phagosomes to microtubules. This binding depends on the
	presence of membrane proteins, most likely integral to the surface
	of phagosomes, and on macrophage cytosol. The cytosolic binding factor
	can interact with microtubules prior to the addition of phagosomes
	to the assay, suggesting that it is a microtubule-associated protein
	(MAP). Consistent with this, depletion of MAPs from the cytosol by
	microtubule affinity removes all binding activity. Microtubule motor
	proteins show no binding activity, whereas a crude MAP preparation
	is sufficient to support binding and to restore full binding activity
	to MAP-depleted cytosol. We show that the activating MAP factor is

	Abstract = {Submicroscopic molecular clusters (oligomers) of class I HLA have
	been detected by physical techniques [e.g. fluorescence resonance
	energy transfer (FRET) and single particle tracking of molecular
	diffusion] at the surface of various activated and transformed human
	cells, including B lymphocytes. Here, the sensitivity of this homotypic
	association to exogenous beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) and the
	role of free heavy chains (FHC) in class I HLA oligomerization were
	investigated on a B lymphoblastoid cell line, JY. Scanning near-field
	optical microscopy and FRET data both demonstrated that FHC and class
	I HLA heterodimers are co-clustered at the cell surface. Culturing
	the cells with excess beta(2)m resulted in a reduced co-clustering
	and decreased molecular homotypic association, as assessed by FRET.
	The decreased HLA clustering on JY target cells (antigen-presenting
	cells) was accompanied with their reduced susceptibility to specific
	lysis by allospecific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). JY B
	cells with reduced HLA clustering also provoked significantly weaker
	T cell activation signals, such as lower expression of CD69 activation
	marker and lower magnitude of TCR down-regulation, than did the untreated
	B cells. These results together suggest that the actual level of
	beta(2)m available at the cell surface can control CTL activation
	and the subsequent cytotoxic effector function through regulation
	of the homotypic HLA-I association. This might be especially important
	in some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases where elevated serum

	scaffolds, including changes in available substrate area, shape,

	discriminate between different types of spatial signals. Here we
	utilize a soft-lithography-based, microcontact printing technology
	in combination with automated computerized image analysis to explore
	the relationship between ECM geometry and directional motility. When
	fibroblast cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated adhesive islands
	with the same area (900 micrometers2) but different geometric forms
	(square, triangle, pentagon, hexagon, trapezoid, various parallelograms)
	and aspect ratios, cells preferentially extended new lamellipodia
	from their corners. In addition, by imposing these simple geometric
	constraints through ECM, cells were directed to deposit new fibronectin
	fibrils in these same corner regions. These data indicate that mammalian
	cells can sense edges within ECM patterns that exhibit a wide range
	of angularity and that they use these spatial cues to guide where
	they will deposit ECM and extend new motile processes during the
	process of directional migration.},

	Abstract = {Focal adhesions play a major role in maintaining the cell shape and
	motility, and in regulating numerous cellular processes. Observations
	suggest that the functioning of focal adhesions is possible due to
	their dynamic nature, yet the mechanisms that govern their motion
	are not well understood. This study addresses the process of focal
	adhesion remodeling using two distinct theoretical approaches. Namely,
	adhesion sites are modeled as clusters of integrins that are either
	bound to cytoskeletal elements or dissociated and temporarily free
	of any attachments. In the first approach effects of cluster size
	and permeability on the diffusion of mobile adhesion structures are
	studied using Brinkman's effective medium approach. Diffusion coefficients
	calculated by this hydrodynamic model significantly decrease with
	the increase in contact area (the effective size of the focal adhesion).
	In the second approach focal adhesions are modeled as clusters of
	transmembrane proteins tightly connected to the cytoskeleton, but
	still capable of motion. The remodeling of these clusters is coupled
	to the deformation of the cytoskeleton by means of equating energies
	at the end states of a reversible elastodynamic interaction. Due
	to large uncertainty of the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton
	properties, predicted diffusion coefficients vary within several
	orders of magnitude. However, a reasonable set of parameters for
	each model yields diffusion coefficients that compare favorably with
	those measured by single-particle tracking (SPT), fluorescence recovery
	after photobleaching (FRAP), and fluorescence digital imaging (FDI).
	The estimated Young's modulus of the stress fibers is also in good
	agreement with measurements. To assess the relevance of the models
	to focal adhesion remodeling and to improve their predictions, further
	data on the morphology of focal adhesions and on properties of the
	plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton are required.},

	Abstract = {Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are proteins that reversibly
	bind to and regulate microtubule dynamics and functions in vivo.
	We examined the dynamics of binding of a MAP called ensconsin (E-MAP-115)
	to microtubules in vivo. We used 5xGFP-EMTB, a construct in which
	the microtubule-binding domain of ensconsin (EMTB) is fused to five
	copies of green fluorescent protein (GFP), as a reporter molecule
	amenable to the use of fluorescent speckle microscopy. Fluorescent
	speckle microscopy (FSM) sequences and kymograph analyses showed
	rapid dynamics of speckles comprised of 5xGFP-EMTB in untreated cells.
	By contrast, in detergent-lysed cytoskeletons, speckles were not
	dynamic. Since detergent-lysed cytoskeletons differ from living cells
	in that they lack both ATP and dynamic microtubules, we used azide
	treatment to substantially reduce the level of ATP in living cells
	and we used Taxol to halt microtubule dynamics. Both treatments slowed
	the dynamics of 5xGFP-EMTB speckles observed by FSM. We also used
	fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to quantify the
	half-time of binding and dissociation of the 5xGFP-EMTB chimera and
	to compare this half-time to that of the full-length MAP molecule.
	In untreated cells, the t(g) of either 5xGFP-EMTB or full-length
	GFP-ensconsin was similarly rapid (approximately 4 seconds), while
	in ATP-reduced and Taxol-treated cells, t(g) was increased to 210
	seconds and 40 seconds, respectively. In detergent-extracted cells
	no recovery was seen. Consistent with the rapid dynamics of 5xGFP-EMTB
	measured with fluorescent speckle microscopy and FRAP, we estimated
	that the affinity of the MAP for microtubules is approximately 40
	microM in untreated living cells, compared with approximately 1 microM
	in vitro. However, K(D,app) was not significantly changed in the
	presence of azide and was increased to 110 microM in the presence
	of Taxol. To test whether changes in the phosphorylation state of
	cellular proteins might be responsible for altering the dynamics
	of ensconsin binding, we used FSM to monitor staurosporine-treated
	cells. Staurosporine treatment substantially halted dynamics of 5xGFP-EMTB
	speckles along MTs. Our results show that ensconsin is highly dynamic
	in its association with microtubules, and its microtubule association
	can be altered by in vivo phosphorylation events.},

	Abstract = {The extreme length of axonal processes requires that aerobic ATP production
	and Ca(2+) homeostasis are non-uniformly organized in the cytoplasm.
	As a result, the transport and positioning of mitochondria along
	axons is essential for neuronal homeostasis. Mitochondria undergo
	rapid but intermittent transport in both the anterograde and retrograde
	directions in axons. We have shown that in chick embryonic sensory
	neurons, the transport of mitochondria responds to physiological
	changes in the cell and, particularly, to growth cone activity. When
	an axon is actively elongating, mitochondria move preferentially
	anterograde and then become stationary, accumulating in the region
	of the active growth cone. When axonal elongation ceases, mitochondria
	in the distal axon resume movement but undergo net retrograde transport
	and become uniformly distributed along the axon. This redistribution
	of mitochondria is achieved in two ways: there is a transition between
	motile and stationary mitochondria and a large up- and downregulation
	of their anterograde, but not retrograde, motor activity. Mitochondrial
	transport does not respond to the experimentally induced elongation
	of axons in the absence of an active growth cone, implying that signals
	from the active growth cone regulate transport. To determine the
	nature of these signals, we have focally stimulated the shafts of
	sensory axons in culture with nerve growth factor (NGF) covalently
	conjugated to polystyrene beads. We find that mitochondria accumulate
	at regions of focal NGF stimulation. This response is specific to
	mitochondria and does not result from general disruption of the cytoskeleton
	in the region of stimulation. Disruption of the phosphoinositide
	3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway, one of the signaling pathways downstream
	from NGF-receptor binding, completely eliminates NGF effects on mitochondrial
	behavior in axons. We propose that mitochondrial transport and/or
	docking are regulated in part via NGF/TrkA/PI 3-kinase signaling.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To elucidate how mechanical stresses that are applied to
	the whole organism are transmitted to individual cells and transduced
	into a biochemical response. DESIGN: In this article, we describe
	fundamental design principles that are used to stabilize the musculoskeletal
	system at many different size scales and show that these design features
	are embodied in one particular form of architecture that is known
	as tensegrity. RESULTS: Tensegrity structures are characterized by
	use of continuous tension and local compression; architecture, prestress
	(internal stress prior to application of external force), and triangulation
	play the most critical roles in terms of determining their mechanical
	stability. In living organisms, use of a hierarchy of tensegrity
	networks both optimizes structural efficiency and provides a mechanism
	to mechanically couple the parts with the whole: mechanical stresses
	applied at the macroscale result in structural rearrangements at
	the cell and molecular level. CONCLUSION: Due to use of tensegrity
	architecture, mechanical stress is concentrated and focused on signal
	transducing molecules that physically associate with cell surface
	molecules that anchor cells to extracellular matrix, such as integrins,
	and with load-bearing elements within the internal cytoskeleton and
	nucleus. Mechanochemical transduction may then proceed through local
	stress-dependent changes in molecular mechanics, thermodynamics,
	and kinetics within the cell. In this manner, the entire cellular
	response to stress may be orchestrated and tuned by altering the
	prestress in the cell, just as changing muscular tone can alter mechanical
	stability and structural coordination throughout the whole musculoskeletal

	that contained micrometer-scale islands of extracellular matrix (ECM)
	separated by nonadhesive regions such that the pattern of islands
	determined the distribution and position of bovine and human endothelial

	Progressively restricting bovine and human endothelial cell extension
	by culturing cells on smaller and smaller micropatterned adhesive

@article{Chen2004,
	Abstract = {Mechanical forces play an important role in the organization, growth,
	maturation, and function of living tissues. At the cellular level,
	many of the biological responses to external forces originate at
	two types of specialized microscale structures: focal adhesions that
	link cells to their surrounding extracellular matrix and adherens
	junctions that link adjacent cells. Transmission of forces from outside
	the cell through cell-matrix and cell-cell contacts appears to control
	the maturation or disassembly of these adhesions and initiates intracellular
	signaling cascades that ultimately alter many cellular behaviors.
	In response to externally applied forces, cells actively rearrange
	the organization and contractile activity of the cytoskeleton and
	redistribute their intracellular forces. Recent studies suggest that
	the localized concentration of these cytoskeletal tensions at adhesions
	is also a major mediator of mechanical signaling. This review summarizes
	the role of mechanical forces in the formation, stabilization, and
	dissociation of focal adhesions and adherens junctions and outlines
	how integration of signals from these adhesions over the entire cell
	body affects how a cell responds to its mechanical environment. This
	review also describes advanced optical, lithographic, and computational

	Abstract = {Microcontact printing (microcP) is a cost effective and simple method
	to create chemically micropatterned surfaces for cell biological
	applications. We have combined the technique with the spontaneous
	molecular assembly of a polycationic PEG-grafted copolymer, poly-L-lysine-g-poly(ethylene
	glycol) (PLL-g-PEG). PLL-g-PEG with omega-functionalized PEG chains
	was print-transferred onto tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) or glass
	substrates, resulting in patterns with a lateral resolution down
	to 1 microm. Subsequently, dipping in an aqueous solution of non-functionalized
	PLL-g-PEG was used to backfill the non-printed regions of the surface,
	rendering them highly protein and thus cell resistant. In a second
	approach, proteins were stamped and a PLL-g-PEG backfill was applied
	for passivation of the bare surface regions. Printing of peptide(RGD)-functionalized
	PLL-g-PEG or proteins combined with a subsequent PLL-g-PEG backfill
	can be applied to a wide variety of substrate materials with negatively
	charged surfaces such as TCPS, glass and many metal oxides. We have
	tested the printed surfaces with human foreskin fibroblasts for cell
	adhesion and long-term performance and with fish epidermal keratocytes
	for cell motility and short-time behaviour. Both cell types reacted
	selectively to the surface micropatterns. Fibroblasts adhered to
	the printed (adhesive) regions only, where they remained attached
	up to at least 1 week and were even able to proliferate. Keratocyte
	spreading and motility were also directed by the geometry of the
	underlying patterns. The results prove that microcP in conjunction
	with the use of PLL-g-PEG and its derivatives provides a simple and
	robust alternative to previously reported micropatterning methods

	Abstract = {Cell adhesion and motility depend strongly on the interactions between
	cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates. When plated onto
	artificial adhesive surfaces, cells first flatten and deform extensively
	as they spread. At the molecular level, the interaction of membrane-based
	integrins with the ECM has been shown to initiate a complex cascade
	of signaling events [1], which subsequently triggers cellular morphological
	changes and results in the generation of contractile forces [2].
	Here, we focus on the early stages of cell spreading and probe their
	dynamics by quantitative visualization and biochemical manipulation
	with a variety of cell types and adhesive surfaces, adhesion receptors,
	and cytoskeleton-altering drugs. We find that the dynamics of adhesion
	follows a universal power-law behavior. This is in sharp contrast
	with the common belief that spreading is regulated by either the
	diffusion of adhesion receptors toward the growing adhesive patch
	[3-5] or by actin polymerization [6-8]. To explain this, we propose
	a simple quantitative and predictive theory that models cells as
	viscous adhesive cortical shells enclosing a less viscous interior.
	Thus, although cell spreading is driven by well-identified biomolecular
	interactions, it is dynamically limited by its mesoscopic structure
	and material properties.},

	Abstract = {To quantitatively investigate the trafficking of the transmembrane
	lectin VIP36 and its relation to cargo-containing transport carriers
	(TCs), we analyzed a C-terminal fluorescent-protein (FP) fusion,
	VIP36-SP-FP. When expressed at moderate levels, VIP36-SP-FP localized
	to the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and intermediate transport
	structures, and colocalized with epitope-tagged VIP36. Temperature
	shift and pharmacological experiments indicated VIP36-SP-FP recycled
	in the early secretory pathway, exhibiting trafficking representative
	of a class of transmembrane cargo receptors, including the closely
	related lectin ERGIC53. VIP36-SP-FP trafficking structures comprised
	tubules and globular elements, which translocated in a saltatory
	manner. Simultaneous visualization of anterograde secretory cargo
	and VIP36-SP-FP indicated that the globular structures were pre-Golgi
	carriers, and that VIP36-SP-FP segregated from cargo within the Golgi
	and was not included in post-Golgi TCs. Organelle-specific bleach
	experiments directly measured the exchange of VIP36-SP-FP between
	the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Fitting a two-compartment
	model to the recovery data predicted first order rate constants of
	1.22 +/- 0.44%/min for ER --> Golgi, and 7.68 +/- 1.94%/min for Golgi
	--> ER transport, revealing a half-time of 113 +/- 70 min for leaving
	the ER and 1.67 +/- 0.45 min for leaving the Golgi, and accounting
	for the measured steady-state distribution of VIP36-SP-FP (13% Golgi/87%
	ER). Perturbing transport with AlF(4)(-) treatment altered VIP36-SP-GFP
	distribution and changed the rate constants. The parameters of the
	model suggest that relatively small differences in the first order
	rate constants, perhaps manifested in subtle differences in the tendency
	to enter distinct TCs, result in large differences in the steady-state

	a signal transduction pathway. The specific labeling of the receptor
	coupled to a T7-tag at its N-terminus, stably expressed in fibroblastic

	mode (90%) composed of a long-term random diffusion and a short-term
	confined diffusion, and corresponding to a diffusion confined within
	a domain that itself diffuses. The results indicate that the confinement
	is due to an effective harmonic potential generated by long-range
	attraction between the membrane proteins. A simple model for interacting
	membrane proteins diffusion is proposed that explains the variations
	with the domain size of the short-term and long-term diffusion coefficients.},

	and quality control of newly synthesized proteins. Green fluorescent
	protein (GFP) was used as a noninvasive probe to determine the viscous
	properties of the aqueous lumen of the ER. GFP was targeted to the
	ER lumen of CHO cells by transient transfection with cDNA encoding
	GFP (S65T/F64L mutant) with a C-terminus KDEL retention sequence
	and upstream prolactin secretory sequence. Repeated laser illumination
	of a fixed 2-micrometers diameter spot resulted in complete bleaching
	of ER-associated GFP throughout the cell, indicating a continuous
	ER lumen. A residual amount (<1%) of GFP-KDEL was perinuclear and
	noncontiguous with the ER, presumably within a pre- or cis-Golgi
	compartment involved in KDEL-substrate retention. Quantitative spot
	photobleaching with a single brief bleach pulse indicated that GFP
	was fully mobile with a t1/2 for fluorescence recovery of 88 +/-
	5 ms (SE; 60x lens) and 143 +/- 8 ms (40x). Fluorescence recovery
	was abolished by paraformaldehyde except for a small component of
	reversible photobleaching with t1/2 of 3 ms. For comparison, the
	t1/2 for photobleaching of GFP in cytoplasm was 14 +/- 2 ms (60x)
	and 24 +/- 1 ms (40x). Utilizing a mathematical model that accounted
	for ER reticular geometry, a GFP diffusion coefficient of 0.5-1 x
	10(-7) cm2/s was computed, 9-18-fold less than that in water and
	3-6-fold less than that in cytoplasm. By frequency-domain microfluorimetry,
	the GFP rotational correlation time was measured to be 39 +/- 8 ns,
	approximately 2-fold greater than that in water but comparable to
	that in the cytoplasm. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
	using a 40x lens was measured (at 23 degrees C unless otherwise indicated)
	for several potential effectors of ER structure and/or lumen environment:
	t1/2 values (in ms) were 143 +/- 8 (control), 100 +/- 13 (37 degrees

@article{DeBrabander1988,
	Abstract = {Transferrin receptors labeled with the B3/25 monoclonal antibody-gold
	complexes were followed in living A431 cells by using video-enhanced
	contrast microscopy. Initially, the antibody-gold complexes bind
	to receptors which are freely mobile on the upper cell surface; they
	then become trapped at the inner margins of the peripheral lamellae
	and internalize. During endocytosis discrete gold-loaded vesicular
	elements first appear, and then, as they fuse, a heterogenous peripheral
	endosomal compartment forms. The endosomes from this compartment
	then begin to migrate centripetally through the cytoplasm in a saltatory
	way so that within 15 min gold label accumulates in a juxtanuclear
	endosome compartment. This compartment, which consists mainly of
	multivesicular bodies, is thus formed by the influx and retention
	of peripheral endosomal elements and their continued fusion in the
	juxtanuclear area. Although their overall migration is inward, saltating
	endosomes frequently reverse their direction of movement. As label
	builds up in the juxtanuclear area, small vesicles containing gold
	label continuously pinch off from the larger elements and migrate
	toward the cell periphery. Experiments with nocodazole and sodium
	azide show that the saltatory movements, the accumulation and retention
	of endosomes in the juxtanuclear area, and the separation of vesicles
	from endosomes are driven by a microtubule-associated, ATP-dependent,
	motility-generating mechanism. Analysis of the movements shows that
	although each individual vesicle saltation can occur unpredictably
	toward the centre or the periphery of the cell, a net centripetal
	flux is observed. Moreover, it is evident that the probability of
	migration toward and maintenance in the juxtanuclear area is related
	to the diameter of the vesicles. We propose a mechanism by which
	bidirectional saltation along microtubules forming a radial network
	may be instrumental in the selective concentration of large endosomes
	in the juxtanuclear area while small vesicles are left free to return
	to the periphery. This process may be responsible for the sorting
	of receptors and ligands destined either for intracellular degradation
	in juxtanuclear lysosomes or, alternatively, for recycling to the
	plasma membrane.},

	Abstract = {Kinesin II is a heterotrimeric plus end-directed microtubule motor

	organelles that kinesin II transports, the question of how this motor
	associates with cargo organelles remains unanswered. To address this

	Through analysis of kinesin II-mediated melanosome motility, we have
	determined that the dynactin complex, known as an anchor for cytoplasmic

	that the putative cargo-binding subunit of Xenopus kinesin II, Xenopus
	kinesin II-associated protein (XKAP), binds directly to the p150Glued
	subunit of dynactin. This interaction occurs through aa 530-793 of

	Abstract = {This paper presents first results from a study where we developed
	a generic framework for analysing inter-sarcomere dynamics. Our objective
	is to find an accurate description of a muscle as a linear motor
	composed of parallel and series coupled subunits. The quality of
	theoretical models can be tested through their ability to predict
	experimental observations. With the current method we have found
	rigorous mathematical explanations for mechanisms such as sarcomere
	popping, extra tension and homogenization. These phenomena have been
	observed for many years in single fibers experiments, yet have never
	been completely understood in terms of a mechanical model. Now they
	can be explained on a theoretical basis. Interestingly, rather simplistic
	descriptions of each of the various molecular components in the sarcomere
	(actin-myosin cross-bridges, titin and contributions from passive
	elastic components) are sufficient to predict these behaviors. The
	complexity of a real muscle fiber is addressed through rigorous coupling
	of the single component models in a system of differential equations.
	We examine the properties of the differential equations, based on
	a down-stripped model, which permits the derivation of analytical
	solutions. They suggest that the contraction characteristics of inter-connected
	sarcomeres are essentially dictated by the initial distribution of
	the sarcomeres on the force-length curve and their starting velocities.
	The complete model is applied to show the complexity of inter-sarcomere
	dynamics of activated fibers in stretch-release experiments with
	either external force or length control. Seemingly contradictory
	and unexpected observations from single fiber experiments, which
	have hitherto been discussed with the argument of uncontrollable
	biological variability, turn out to be a consistent set of possible
	fiber responses. They result from a convolution of multiple relatively
	simple rules each of them defining a certain characteristics of the
	single sarcomere.},

	trajectories reveals that zones can be revisited even tens of seconds

	The analysis of periodic CRAC translocation to the leading edge of

@article{Elbert1998,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We present the synthesis, characterization and initial
	structure-function analysis of a new class of bioactive agent that
	allows the application of techniques from colloid science to biological
	surfaces. Stable colloidal suspensions can be generated by immobilizing
	a dense brush of soluble polymer at the colloidal surface, creating
	a zone protected against the adhesion of approaching particles, a
	phenomenon termed polymeric steric stabilization. This is often accomplished
	for aqueous colloidal dispersions using adsorbing block copolymers.
	We demonstrate that water-soluble block copolymers can be designed
	to adsorb onto heterogeneous biological surfaces and block cell-cell
	and cell-surface adhesion, using polymer compositions and architectures
	that are quite different from surfactants used for stabilizing nonbiological
	colloidal dispersions. RESULTS: Comb copolymers were synthesized
	having polycationic backbones (poly-L-lysine, PLL), serving as the
	anchor for binding to the net negatively charged biological surfaces,
	grafted with water-soluble polynonionic chains (polyethylene glycol,
	PEG), to block biological recognition, producing PLL-graft-PEG copolymers.
	Specific copolymers were found to sterically stabilize red blood
	cells from lectin-induced hemagglutination and fibroblasts from adhesion
	to fibronectin-coated surfaces. The polymer design principles, which
	appear to be unique for adsorption to heterogeneous biological surfaces,
	require the use of very high molecular weight comb copolymers, perhaps
	because anionic sites are non-uniformly distributed on biological
	surfaces, and the ability of larger copolymers to span between highly

	Abstract = {The mechanisms of localization and retention of membrane proteins
	in the inner nuclear membrane and the fate of this membrane system
	during mitosis were studied in living cells using the inner nuclear
	membrane protein, lamin B receptor, fused to green fluorescent protein
	(LBR-GFP). Photobleaching techniques revealed the majority of LBR-GFP
	to be completely immobilized in the nuclear envelope (NE) of interphase
	cells, suggesting a tight binding to heterochromatin and/or lamins.
	A subpopulation of LBR-GFP within ER membranes, by contrast, was
	entirely mobile and diffused rapidly and freely (D = 0. 41 +/- 0.1
	microm2/s). High resolution confocal time-lapse imaging in mitotic
	cells revealed LBR-GFP redistributing into the interconnected ER
	membrane system in prometaphase, exhibiting the same high mobility
	and diffusion constant as observed in interphase ER membranes. LBR-GFP
	rapidly diffused across the cell within the membrane network defined
	by the ER, suggesting the integrity of the ER was maintained in mitosis,
	with little or no fragmentation and vesiculation. At the end of mitosis,
	nuclear membrane reformation coincided with immobilization of LBR-GFP
	in ER elements at contact sites with chromatin. LBR-GFP-containing
	ER membranes then wrapped around chromatin over the course of 2-3
	min, quickly and efficiently compartmentalizing nuclear material.
	Expansion of the NE followed over the course of 30-80 min. Thus,
	selective changes in lateral mobility of LBR-GFP within the ER/NE
	membrane system form the basis for its localization to the inner
	nuclear membrane during interphase. Such changes, rather than vesiculation
	mechanisms, also underlie the redistribution of this molecule during
	NE disassembly and reformation in mitosis.},

@article{Feder1996,
	Abstract = {Protein lateral mobility in cell membranes is generally measured using
	fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR). Since the development
	of this technique, the data have been interpreted by assuming free
	Brownian diffusion of cell surface receptors in two dimensions, an
	interpretation that requires that a subset of the diffusing species
	remains immobile. The origin of this so-called immobile fraction
	remains a mystery. In FPR, the motions of thousands of particles
	are inherently averaged, inevitably masking the details of individual
	motions. Recently, tracking of individual cell surface receptors
	has identified several distinct types of motion (Gross and Webb,
	1988; Ghosh and Webb, 1988, 1990, 1994; Kusumi et al. 1993; Qian
	et al. 1991; Slattery, 1995), thereby calling into question the classical
	interpretation of FPR data as free Brownian motion of a limited mobile
	fraction. We have measured the motion of fluorescently labeled immunoglobulin
	E complexed to high affinity receptors (Fc epsilon RI) on rat basophilic
	leukemia cells using both single particle tracking and FPR. As in
	previous studies, our tracking results show that individual receptors
	may diffuse freely, or may exhibit restricted, time-dependent (anomalous)
	diffusion. Accordingly, we have analyzed FPR data by a new model
	to take this varied motion into account, and we show that the immobile
	fraction may be due to particles moving with the anomalous subdiffusion
	associated with restricted lateral mobility. Anomalous subdiffusion
	denotes random molecular motion in which the mean square displacements
	grow as a power law in time with a fractional positive exponent less
	than one. These findings call for a new model of cell membrane structure.},

	Abstract = {We applied a recently developed microrheology technique based on colloidal
	magnetic tweezers to measure local viscoelastic moduli and active
	forces in cells of Dictyostelium discoideum. The active transport
	of nonmagnetic beads taken up by phagocytosis was analyzed by single
	particle tracking, which allowed us to measure the length of straight
	steps and the corresponding velocities of the movements. The motion
	consists of a superposition of nearly straight long-range steps (step
	length in the micrometer range) and local random walks (step widths
	about 0.1 microm). The velocities for the former type of motion range
	from 1 to 3 microm/s. They decrease with increasing bead size and
	are attributed to rapid active transport along microtubuli. The short-range
	local motions exhibit velocities of less than 0.5 microm/s and reflect
	the internal dynamics of the cytoplasm. Viscoelastic response curves
	were measured by application of force pulses with amplitudes varying
	between 50 pN and 400 pN. Analysis of the response curves in terms
	of mechanical equivalent circuits yielded cytoplasmic viscosities
	varying between 10 and 350 Pa s. Simultaneous analysis of the response
	curves and of the bead trajectories showed that the motion of the
	beads is determined by the local yield stress within the cytoplasmic
	scaffold and cisternae, which varies between sigma = 30 Pa and 250
	Pa. The motion of intracellular particles is interpreted in terms
	of viscoplastic behavior and the apparent viscosity is a measure
	of the reciprocal rate of bond breakage within the cytoplasmatic
	network. The viscoelastic moduli are interpreted as dynamic quantities
	which depend sensitively on the amplitude of the forces, and the
	rate of bond breakage is determined by the Arrhenius-Kramers law
	with the activation energy being reduced by the work performed by
	the applied force. In agreement with previous work, we provide evidence

@article{Fishkind1996,
	Abstract = {The mitotic spindle has long been recognized to play an essential
	role in determining the position of the cleavage furrow during cell
	division, however little is known about the mechanisms involved in
	this process. One attractive hypothesis is that signals from the
	spindle may function to induce reorganization of cortical structures
	and transport of actin filaments to the equator during cytokinesis.
	While an important idea, few experiments have directly tested this
	model. In the present study, we have used a variety of experimental
	approaches to identify microtubule-dependent effects on key cortical
	events during normal cell cleavage, including cortical flow, reorientation
	of actin filaments, and formation of the contractile apparatus. Single-particle
	tracking experiments showed that the microtubule disrupting drug
	nocodazole induces an inhibition of the movements of cell surface
	receptors following anaphase onset, while the microtubule stabilizing
	drug taxol causes profound changes in the overall pattern of receptor
	movements. These effects were accompanied by a related set of changes
	in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In nocodazole-treated
	cells, the three-dimensional organization of cortical actin filaments
	appeared less ordered than in controls. Measurements with fluorescence-detected
	linear dichroism indicated a decrease in the alignment of filaments
	along the spindle axis. In contrast, actin filaments in taxol-treated
	cells showed an increased alignment along the equator on both the
	ventral and dorsal cortical surfaces, mirroring the redistribution
	pattern of surface receptors. Together, these experiments show that
	spindle microtubules are involved in directing bipolar flow of surface
	receptors and reorganization of actin filaments during cell division,
	thus acting as a stimulus for positioning cortical cytoskeletal components

	interaction modes ranging from adhesive sticking to dynamic crawling.
	Both static and dynamic contacts support sustained triggering of

	and proliferation. In dynamic interactions, T cells crawl across
	the surface of the APC at speeds of 2-6 micro m/min and simultaneously
	establish an asymmetric tight yet mobile junction plane, representing
	a dynamic immunological synapse. In dynamic synapses three functional
	compartments of the polarized T cell are in close contact with the

	mobility, the asymmetric junction is topographically suited for receptor
	scanning and engagement at the leading edge, retrograde receptor
	movement along the junction, and exit from the uropod. Herein we
	develop a model on scanning encounters between T cells and APCs that

	Abstract = {The locomotion of T lymphocytes within 3-D extracellular matrix (ECM)
	is a highly dynamic and flexible process following the principles
	of ameboid movement. Ameboid motility is characterized by a polarized
	yet simple cell shape allowing high speed, rapid directional oscillations,
	and low affinity interactions to the substrate that are coupled to
	a low degree of cytoskeletal organization lacking discrete focal
	contacts. At the onset of T cell migration, a default program, here
	described as migration-associated polarization, is initiated, resulting
	in the polar redistribution of cell surface receptors and cytoskeletal
	elements. Polarization involves protein cycling either to the leading
	edge (i.e. LFA-1, CD45RO, chemokine receptors, focal adhesion kinase),
	to a central polarizing compartment (MTOC, PKC, MARCKS), or into
	the uropod (CD44, CD43, ICAM-1 and -3, beta1 integrins). The function
	of such compartment formation may be important in chemotactic response,
	scanning of encountered cells, and a flexible and adaptive interaction
	with the ECM itself. Due to the simple shape and a diffusely organized
	cytoskeleton, the interactions to the surrounding extracellular matrix
	are rapid and reversible and appear to allow a broad spectrum of
	molecular migration strategies. These range from (1) adhesive and
	haptokinetic following i.e. chemokine-induced motility across 2-D
	surfaces to (2) largely integrin-independent migration predominantly
	guided by shape change and morphological flexibility, as seen in
	3-D type I collagen matrices. Their prominent capacity to rapidly
	adapt to a given structural environment coupled to contact guidance
	mechanisms set T cell locomotion apart from slow, focal contact-dependent
	and more adhesive migration strategies established by fibroblast-like
	cells and cell clusters. It is therefore likely that, within the
	tissues, besides chemotactic or haptotactic gradients, the preformed
	matrix structure has an important impact on T cell trafficking and
	positioning in health and disease.},

	a highly dynamic leading edge and a trailing uropod, whereas invasive
	melanoma cells are larger, highly polarized and less dynamic. In
	contrast to leukocyte, tumor cells may additionally develop migrating

	Abstract = {The cycling of membrane receptors for substrate-bound proteins via
	their interaction with the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge
	of growth cones and other motile cells is important for neurite outgrowth
	and cell migration. Receptor delivered to the leading edge binds
	to its ligand, which induces coupling of the receptor to a rearward
	flowing network of actin filaments. This coupling is thought to facilitate
	advance. We show here that a soluble growth factor stimulates this
	cycling. We have used single particle tracking to monitor the effects
	of nerve growth factor (NGF) on the movements of beta1 integrin in
	the plane of the plasma membrane of the filopodia of growth cones.
	Beta1 integrin was visualized by its binding of 0.2 microm beads
	coated with a monoclonal Ab directed against an extracellular epitope
	distant from the binding site for extracellular matrix ligands. The
	beads were observed by video microscopy. Beads coated with a low
	concentration of antibody, and therefore bound to unliganded receptor
	with little cross-linking, showed an increase in both diffusion and
	directed forward transport in response to NGF. Transport had a net
	velocity of 37 microm/minute and was characterized by brief periods
	of sustained forward excursions with a velocity of 75-150 microm/minute.
	There was a 2-fold increase in the number of beads accumulated at
	the tips of filopodia after 10 minutes, indicating that NGF enhanced
	the delivery of beta1 integrin to the periphery. Forward transport
	was dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton and myosin ATPase,
	since treatment with cytochalasin D or the myosin ATPase inhibitor
	butanedione monoxime inhibited the transport but not the diffusion
	of receptors. NGF also greatly increased the steady rearward migration
	of beads coated with a high density of (&bgr;)1 integrin antibody,
	indicating that coupling of cross-linked receptor to the retrograde
	flow of actin is also enhanced. The rate of the retrograde flow of
	actin was unaffected by NGF. These studies show that a soluble factor
	can stimulate the coupling of a receptor for substrate-bound factor
	to two actomyosin-based transport mechanisms and thus facilitate
	the response of the growth cone to the substrate-bound factor by
	increasing cycling of the receptor at the periphery.},

	are present on a gramophone disk. After drying, the particles are
	located on the bottom of the grooves and are thus aligned in a one-dimensional
	array. The new alignment procedure is demonstrated with a suspension
	of fluorescent polystyrene microspheres (diameter 3.8 microns) and
	a suspension of the unicellular algae chlorella vulgaris (diameter
	about 3 microns). It appears that the alignment of cells and spheres
	is very good. When using microspheres, more than 95% of the particles
	in the grooves are located within +/- 2 microns of the centre line
	of the groove. Based upon this cell-alignment principle, a new cytometer,
	named the cytodisk, is proposed. The proposed system has a number
	of advantages over the flow cytometer, among which is the unique
	ability of relocating a previously measured cell for further measurement
	or visual examination. A prototype of a cytodisk, developed for initial
	test measurements, was built in our laboratory. The apparatus, constructed
	from a record player and ordinary long-playing records, uses a simple
	mechanical tracking system and a single optical fiber for fluorescence
	excitation and detection. With this apparatus it is demonstrated
	that a cytodisk can indeed perform quite well: A histogram of fluorescing

	Abstract = {Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-based motor with diverse cellular
	roles. Here, we use mutations in the dynein heavy chain gene to impair
	the motor's function, and employ biophysical measurements to demonstrate
	that cytoplasmic dynein is responsible for the minus end motion of
	bidirectionally moving lipid droplets in early Drosophila embryos.
	This analysis yields an estimate for the force that a single cytoplasmic
	dynein exerts in vivo (1.1 pN). It also allows us to quantitate dynein-mediated
	cargo motion in vivo, providing a framework for investigating how
	dynein's activity is controlled. We identify three distinct travel
	states whose general features also characterize plus end motion.
	These states are preserved in different developmental stages. We
	had previously provided evidence that for each travel direction,
	single droplets are moved by multiple motors of the same type (Welte
	et al. 1998). Droplet travel distances (runs) are much shorter than
	expected for multiple motors based on in vitro estimates of cytoplasmic
	dynein processivity. Therefore, we propose the existence of a process
	that ends runs before the motors fall off the microtubules. We find
	that this process acts with a constant probability per unit distance,
	and is typically coupled to a switch in travel direction. A process
	with similar properties governs plus end motion, and its regulation
	controls the net direction of transport.},

	single-cell tracking. Directly after incorporation, 50-90% of DC
	from the spleen (spDC) and Langerhans cells freshly isolated from

	Whereas mature spDC showed multilateral pseudopod dynamics as well
	as fast and heterogeneous migration, immature fLC displayed a spherical
	shape with faint membrane processes and very homogenous, slow migration
	characteristics. In the absence of external stimuli, migration of
	both, spDC and fLC, vanished after >36 h due to cell death. Maintaining
	fLC viability by external granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
	factor or tumor necrosis factor alpha prolonged migration up to 5
	days. During this period fLC transformed into mature cells with large

	similar to spDC. In randomly polymerized collagen matrices cell paths

	Abstract = {In living cells, cytoskeletal filaments interact with the plasma membrane
	to form structures that play a key role in cell shape and mechanical

	we designed an in vitro self-assembled network of actin filaments
	attached to the outer surface of giant unilamellar vesicles. Optical
	tweezers and single-particle tracking experiments are used to study
	the rich dynamics of these actin-coated membranes (ACM). We show
	that microrheology studies can be carried out on such an individual

	the thermally excited position fluctuations of a probe bead attached
	biochemically to the membrane. We propose a model that relates the
	power spectrum of these thermal fluctuations to the viscoelastic
	properties of the membrane. The presence of the actin network modifies
	strongly the membrane dynamics with respect to a fluid, lipid bilayer
	one. It induces first a finite (omega=0) two-dimensional (2D) shear
	modulus G(0)(2D) approximately 0.5 to 5 microN/m in the membrane
	plane. Moreover, the frequency dependence at high frequency of the

	the bending modulus (kappa(ACM)(f) approximately f(0.55+/-0.21))

	These results are consistent with a common exponent of 0.75 for both

	superior to slow scan cooled CCD and intensified interline transfer
	CCD cameras for monitoring lateral diffusion of rapidly moving FS
	with nanometer level precision. To estimate the maximum tracking
	precision, a 4 sec-sequence comprising 120 images of FS fixed to

	from the origin. The SIT camera was then used to track FS attached
	to lipids and Thy1 molecules on the surface of fibroblasts. The lateral
	diffusion of lipid-bound FS was unconstrained, and the ensemble averaged
	diffusion coefficient was 0.80 x 10(-9) cm2/sec. Thy1-bound FS existed

	Abstract = {Quantitative time-lapse imaging data of single cells expressing the
	transmembrane protein, vesicular stomatitis virus ts045 G protein
	fused to green fluorescent protein (VSVG-GFP), were used for kinetic
	modeling of protein traffic through the various compartments of the
	secretory pathway. A series of first order rate laws was sufficient
	to accurately describe VSVG-GFP transport, and provided compartment
	residence times and rate constants for transport into and out of
	the Golgi complex and delivery to the plasma membrane. For ER to
	Golgi transport the mean rate constant (i.e., the fraction of VSVG-GFP
	moved per unit of time) was 2.8% per min, for Golgi to plasma membrane
	transport it was 3.0% per min, and for transport from the plasma
	membrane to a degradative site it was 0.25% per min. Because these
	rate constants did not change as the concentration of VSVG-GFP in
	different compartments went from high (early in the experiment) to
	low (late in the experiment), secretory transport machinery was never
	saturated during the experiments. The processes of budding, translocation,
	and fusion of post-Golgi transport intermediates carrying VSVG- GFP
	to the plasma membrane were also analyzed using quantitative imaging
	techniques. Large pleiomorphic tubular structures, rather than small
	vesicles, were found to be the primary vehicles for Golgi to plasma
	membrane transport of VSVG-GFP. These structures budded as entire
	domains from the Golgi complex and underwent dynamic shape changes
	as they moved along microtubule tracks to the cell periphery. They
	carried up to 10,000 VSVG-GFP molecules and had a mean life time
	in COS cells of 3.8 min. In addition, they fused with the plasma
	membrane without intersecting other membrane transport pathways in
	the cell. These properties suggest that the post-Golgi intermediates
	represent a unique transport organelle for conveying large quantities
	of protein cargo from the Golgi complex directly to the plasma membrane.},

@article{Hollenbeck1996,
	Abstract = {Mitochondria in nerve axons display motility behavior that is as distinctive
	as their metabolic function. Unlike many other classes of organelles,
	mitochondria undergo net movement that is the sum of movements in
	both the anterograde and retrograde directions, and their net velocity
	is strongly influenced by their recruitment between stationary and
	motile states. They recently became the first specific class of organelle
	shown to be capable of moving along either microtubule or F-actin
	tracks in the axon, indicating that they probably use a diversity
	of molecular motors. Although we still know relatively little about
	how the movement of specific classes of axonal organelles is coordinated
	with their function in the neuron, in the case of mitochondria it
	is at least clear that their transport delivers them to regions of
	the neuron where ATP consumption is likely to be high, and disperses
	them when local energy needs change. In addition, although mitochondria

@article{Hollenbeck1993,
	Abstract = {Cellular homeostasis in neurons requires that the synthesis and anterograde
	axonal transport of protein and membrane be balanced by their degradation
	and retrograde transport. To address the nature and regulation of
	retrograde transport in cultured sympathetic neurons, I analyzed
	the behavior, composition, and ultrastructure of a class of large,
	phase-dense organelles whose movement has been shown to be influenced
	by axonal growth (Hollenbeck, P. J., and D. Bray. 1987. J. Cell Biol.
	105:2827-2835). In actively elongating axons these organelles underwent
	both anterograde and retrograde movements, giving rise to inefficient
	net retrograde transport. This could be shifted to more efficient,
	higher volume retrograde transport by halting axonal outgrowth, or
	conversely shifted to less efficient retrograde transport with a
	larger anterograde component by increasing the intracellular cyclic
	AMP concentration. When neurons were loaded with Texas red-dextran
	by trituration, autophagy cleared the label from an even distribution
	throughout the neuronal cytosol to a punctate, presumably lysosomal,
	distribution in the cell body within 72 h. During this process, 100%
	of the phase-dense organelles were fluorescent, showing that they
	contained material sequestered from the cytosol and indicating that
	they conveyed this material to the cell body. When 29 examples of
	this class of organelle were identified by light microscopy and then
	relocated using correlative electron microscopy, they had a relatively
	constant ultrastructure consisting of a bilamellar or multilamellar
	boundary membrane and cytoplasmic contents, characteristic of autophagic
	vacuoles. When neurons took up Lucifer yellow, FITC-dextran, or Texas
	red-ovalbumin from the medium via endocytosis at the growth cone,
	100% of the phase-dense organelles became fluorescent, demonstrating
	that they also contain products of endocytosis. Furthermore, pulse-chase
	experiments with fluorescent endocytic tracers confirmed that these
	organelles are formed in the most distal region of the axon and undergo
	net retrograde transport. Quantitative ratiometric imaging with endocytosed
	8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid showed that the mean pH of
	their lumena was 7.05. These results indicate that the endocytic
	and autophagic pathways merge in the distal axon, resulting in a
	class of predegradative organelles that undergo regulated transport
	back to the cell body.},

	Abstract = {Within the cell membrane glycosphingolipids and cholesterol cluster
	together in distinct domains or lipid rafts, along with glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol
	(GPI)-anchored proteins in the outer leaflet and acylated proteins
	in the inner leaflet of the bilayer. These lipid rafts are characterized
	by insolubility in detergents such as Triton X-100 at 4 degrees C.
	Studies on model membrane systems have shown that the clustering
	of glycosphingolipids and GPI-anchored proteins in lipid rafts is
	an intrinsic property of the acyl chains of these membrane components,
	and that detergent extraction does not artefactually induce clustering.
	Cholesterol is not required for clustering in model membranes but
	does enhance this process. Single particle tracking, chemical cross-linking,
	fluorescence resonance energy transfer and immunofluorescence microscopy
	have been used to directly visualize lipid rafts in membranes. The
	sizes of the rafts observed in these studies range from 70-370 nm,
	and depletion of cellular cholesterol levels disrupts the rafts.
	Caveolae, flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane, that
	contain the coat protein caveolin, are also enriched in cholesterol
	and glycosphingolipids. Although caveolae are also insoluble in Triton
	X-100, more selective isolation procedures indicate that caveolae
	do not equate with detergent-insoluble lipid rafts. Numerous proteins
	involved in cell signalling have been identified in caveolae, suggesting
	that these structures may function as signal transduction centres.
	Depletion of membrane cholesterol with cholesterol binding drugs
	or by blocking cellular cholesterol biosynthesis disrupts the formation
	and function of both lipid rafts and caveolae, indicating that these

	Abstract = {Twenty years ago, we proposed a model of developmental control based
	on tensegrity architecture, in which tissue pattern formation in
	the embryo is controlled through mechanical interactions between
	cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) which place the tissue in a
	state of isometric tension (prestress). The model proposed that local
	changes in the mechanical compliance of the ECM, for example, due
	to regional variations in basement membrane degradation beneath growing
	epithelium, may result in local stretching of the ECM and associated
	adherent cells, much like a "run-in-a-stocking". Cell growth and
	function would be controlled locally though physical distortion of
	the associated cells, or changes in cytoskeletal tension. Importantly,
	experimental studies have demonstrated that cultured cells can be
	switched between different fates, including growth, differentiation,
	apoptosis, directional motility and different stem cell lineages,
	by modulating cell shape. Experiments in whole embryonic organ rudiments
	also have confirmed the tight correlation between basement membrane
	thinning, cell tension generation and new bud and branch formation
	during tissue morphogenesis and that this process can be inhibited
	or accelerated by dissipating or enhancing cytoskeletal tension,

	bead, which had been covalently coated with folate, was attached
	to the advancing edge of a Dictyostelium ameba with the aid of an
	optical trap. The bead was transported backward on the cell surface.
	Forty-five percent of the transported beads were internalized. The
	bead motion was analyzed by determining every 33 ms the x-y coordinate
	of the centroid of the phase-contrast image of the bead. The x(t)
	and y(t) traces were smoothed over 1 s and the difference between
	the smoothed (x(t) and y(t)) and the original traces, delta(x) identical
	with x(t) - x(t) and delta(y) identical with y(t) - y(t), were calculated,
	which represented relatively rapid components of the bead motion.
	The plot of delta(2) = (delta(x)(2) + delta(y)(2)) against time could
	be divided into three phases on the basis of the variance of delta(2).
	Comparison of the plot with the video sequence indicated that the

	(intracellular movement). Cytochalasin A at 5 microM completely inhibited

	At 0.25 microM cytochalasin A the duration of the internalization
	phase exhibited a significant increase, but other parameters did

	Abstract = {Dynamitin, a subunit of the microtubule-dependent motor complex, was
	implicated in cell adhesion by binding to MacMARCKS (Macrophage-enriched
	myristoylated alanine-rice C kinase substrate). However, how dynamitin
	is involved in cell adhesion is unclear despite the fact that both
	MacMARCKS and microtubules regulate beta(2) integrin activation.
	We report that dynamitin regulates beta(2) integrin avidity toward
	iC3b by modulating the lateral mobility of beta(2) integrin molecules.
	Using the single particle tracking method, we found that integrin
	molecular mobility in cells expressing the fusion protein CFP (cyan
	fluorescent protein)-dynamitin or CFP-MB (the MacMARCKS binding domain
	peptide of dynamitin) increased 6-fold over the control cells, suggesting
	that disturbing dynamitin function dramatically altered the cytoskeletal
	constraint on beta(2) integrin molecules. Further mechanistic studies
	revealed that overexpression of dynamitin stimulated the phosphorylation
	of endogenous MacMARCKS protein, which lead to the enhanced tyrosine
	phosphorylation of paxillin. This effect of dynamitin correlates
	with the observation that higher concentration of PKC inhibitor is
	required to block beta(2) integrin mobility in dynamitin-expressing
	cells. Although dynamitin acts at the point of MacMARCKS phosphorylation,
	it is upstream of RhoA, because its effect was blocked by RhoA inhibitor.
	Thus, we conclude that dynamitin is a part of the cytoskeletal constraint
	that locks beta(2) integrin in the inactive form.},

	that tracer diffusion was generally independent of filament length
	in agreement with theoretical predictions for diffusion through solutions

	short (< or = 1.0 micron) filaments, although this result was not
	consistently reproducible. Measured diffusion coefficients through
	unregulated F-actin and filaments of lengths > 1.0 micron were more
	rapid than predicted by theory for tracer diffusion through rigid,
	random networks, which was consistent with some degree of actin bundling.
	Avidin-induced cross-linking of biotinylated F-actin did not affect
	diffusion through unregulated F-actin, but in cases where diffusion
	was slower through short filaments this cross-linking method resulted
	in enhanced tracer diffusion rates indistinguishable from unregulated
	F-actin. This finding, in conjunction with increased turbidity of

	cross-linking retarded diffusion through unregulated F-actin and

	Abstract = {The fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) induces the disassembly of
	the Golgi complex in mammalian cells. The drug seems to accentuate
	tubule formation and causes the subsequent fusion with the endoplasmic
	reticulum (ER). To investigate the biochemical requirements and kinetics
	of BFA-induced Golgi disassembly, we have reconstituted the process
	of green fluorescent protein-tagged Golgi complex disassembly in
	streptolysin O-permeabilized semi-intact Chinese hamster ovary cells.
	For quantitative analysis of the morphological changes to the Golgi
	complex in semi-intact cells, we developed a novel morphometric analysis.
	Based on this analysis, we have dissected the BFA-induced Golgi disassembly
	process biochemically into two processes, Golgi tubule formation
	and fusion with the ER, and found that the formation is induced by
	only ATP and the residual factors in the cells and that the subsequent
	fusion is mediated in an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-dependent
	manner via Golgi tubules. Tubulation occurs by two pathways that
	depend on either microtubule integrity or exogenously added cytosol.
	In the presence of GTPgammaS, coat protein I inhibited the Golgi
	tubule fusion with the ER but showed no apparent effect on tubulation.
	Additionally, we analyzed the kinetics of tubulation and fusion independently
	in nocodazole-treated and -untreated semi-intact cells and found
	that tubulation is a rate-limiting step of the Golgi disassembly.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel optical technique for three-dimensional tracking
	of single fluorescent particles using a modified epifluorescence
	microscope containing a weak cylindrical lens in the detection optics
	and a microstepper-controlled fine focus. Images of small, fluorescent
	particles were circular in focus but ellipsoidal above and below
	focus; the major axis of the ellipsoid shifted by 90 degrees in going
	through focus. Particle z position was determined from the image
	shape and orientation by applying a peak detection algorithm to image
	projections along the x and y axes; x, y position was determined
	from the centroid of the particle image. Typical spatial resolution
	was 12 nm along the optical axis and 5 nm in the image plane with
	a maximum sampling rate of 3-4 Hz. The method was applied to track
	fluorescent particles in artificial solutions and living cells. In
	a solution of viscosity 30 cP, the mean squared distance (MSD) traveled
	by a 264 nm diameter rhodamine-labeled bead was linear with time
	to 20 s. The measured diffusion coefficient, 0.0558 +/- 0.001 micron2/s
	(SE, n = 4), agreed with the theoretical value of 0.0556 micron2/s.
	Statistical variability of MSD curves for a freely diffusing bead
	was in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of three-dimensional
	random walks. In a porous glass matrix, the MSD data was curvilinear
	and showed reduced bead diffusion. In cytoplasm of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts,
	bead diffusion was restricted. The water permeability in individual
	Chinese Hamster Ovary cells was measured from the z movement of a

	We have measured the diffusion coefficients of membrane glycoprotein

	Abstract = {We have previously reported that rearward migration of surface particles
	on slowly moving cells is not driven by membrane flow (Sheetz, M.
	P., S. Turney, H. Qian, and E. L. Elson. 1989. Nature (Lond.). 340:284-288)
	and recent photobleaching measurements have ruled out any rapid rearward
	lipid flow (Lee, J., M. Gustafsson, D. E. Magnussen, and K. Jacobson.
	1990. Science (Wash. DC.) 247:1229-1233). It was not possible, however,
	to conclude from those studies that a slower or tank-tread membrane
	lipid flow does not occur. Therefore, we have used the technology
	of single particle tracking to examine the movements of diffusing
	particles on rapidly locomoting fish keratocytes where the membrane
	current is likely to be greatest. The keratocytes had a smooth lamellipodial
	surface on which bound Con A-coated gold particles were observed
	either to track toward the nuclear region (velocity of 0.35 +/- 0.15
	micron/s) or to diffuse randomly (apparent diffusion coefficient
	of [3.5 +/- 2.0] x 10(-10) cm2/s). We detected no systematic drift
	relative to the cell edge of particles undergoing random diffusion
	even after the cell had moved many micrometers. The average net particle
	displacement was 0.01 +/- 2.7% of the cell displacement. These results
	strongly suggest that neither the motions of membrane proteins driven
	by the cytoskeleton nor other possible factors produce a bulk flow
	of membrane lipid.},

	motility. No forward transport of particles has previously been reported,
	however. Here we report rapid forward transport of concanavalin A-coated
	gold particles on the dorsal surfaces of lamellipodia of fish epidermal
	keratocytes. These movements are active, not diffusive, and more
	rapid than either rearward particle transport or the rate of cell
	locomotion. We observed forward transport in migrating, but not in
	stationary cells, and could block the movement by treatment with
	cytochalasin D. These studies demonstrate for the first time that
	small numbers of glycoproteins can be actively transported on the
	surface of the cell to the front of the lamellipodium. We suggest
	that this mechanism transports proteins involved in cell locomotion,
	such as proteins necessary for adhesion, and could also produce an

@article{Kucik1991,
	Abstract = {The active forward movement of cells is often associated with the
	rearward transport of particles over the surfaces of their lamellae.
	Unlike the rest of the lamella, we found that the leading edge (within
	0.5 microns of the cell boundary) is specialized for rearward transport
	of membrane-bound particles, such as Con A-coated latex microspheres.
	Using a single-beam optical gradient trap (optical tweezers) to apply
	restraining forces to particles, we can capture, move and release
	particles at will. When first bound on the central lamellar surface,
	Con A-coated particles would diffuse randomly; when such bound particles
	were brought to the leading edge of the lamella with the optical
	tweezers, they were often transported rearward. As in our previous
	studies, particle transport occurred with a concurrent decrease in
	apparent diffusion coefficient, consistent with attachment to the
	cytoskeleton. For particles at the leading edge of the lamella, weak
	attachment to the cytoskeleton and transport occurred with a half-time
	of 3 s; equivalent particles elsewhere on the lamella showed no detectable
	attachment when monitored for several minutes. Particles held on
	the cell surface by the laser trap attached more strongly to the
	cytoskeleton with time. These particles could escape a trapping force
	of 0.7 X 10(-6) dyne after 18 +/- 14 (sd) s at the leading edge,
	and after 64 +/- 34 (SD) s elsewhere on the lamella. Fluorescent
	succinylated Con A staining showed no corresponding concentration
	of general glycoproteins at the leading edge, but cytochalasin D-resistant
	filamentous actin was found at the leading edge. Our results have
	implications for cell motility: if the forces used for rearward particle
	transport were applied to a rigid substratum, cells would move forward.
	Such a mechanism would be most efficient if the leading edge of the
	cell contained preferential sites for attachment and transport.},

@article{Kucik2001,
	Abstract = {Integrins link the cell's cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix,
	as well as to receptors on other cells. These links occur not only
	at focal contacts but also at smaller integrin-containing protein
	complexes outside of focal contacts. We previously demonstrated the
	importance of focal contact-independent integrin-cytoskeleton interactions
	of beta(2) integrins: activation of adhesion resulted from a release
	of integrins from cytoskeletal constraints. To determine whether
	changes in integrin-cytoskeleton interactions were related to activation
	of the integrin, we used single particle tracking to examine focal
	contact-independent cytoskeletal associations of alpha(IIb)beta(3)-integrin,
	in which activation results in a large conformational change. Direct
	activation of alpha(IIb)beta(3) by mutation did not mimic activation
	of lymphocytes with phorbol ester, because it enhanced integrin-cytoskeleton
	interactions, whereas activation of lymphocytes decreased them. Using
	additional integrin mutants, we found that both alpha- and beta-cytoplasmic
	domains were required for these links. This suggests that 1) both
	beta(2)- and beta(3)-integrins interact with the cytoskeleton outside
	of focal contacts; 2) activation of a cell and activation of an integrin
	are distinct processes, and both can affect integrin-cytoskeleton
	interactions; and 3) the role of the alpha-subunit in integrin-cytoskeleton
	interactions in at least some circumstances is more direct than generally
	supposed.},

	Abstract = {Uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U snRNPs) are components
	of the splicing machinery that removes introns from precursor mRNA.
	Like other splicing factors, U snRNPs are diffusely distributed throughout
	the nucleus and, in addition, are concentrated in distinct nuclear
	substructures referred to as speckles. We have examined the intranuclear
	distribution and mobility of the splicing factor U1 snRNP on a single-molecule
	level. Isolated U1 snRNPs were fluorescently labeled and incubated
	with digitonin-permeabilized 3T3 cells in the presence of Xenopus
	egg extract. By confocal microscopy, U1 snRNPs were found to be imported
	into nuclei, yielding a speckled intranuclear distribution. Employing
	a laser video-microscope optimized for high sensitivity and high
	speed, single U1 snRNPs were visualized and tracked at a spatial
	precision of 35 nm and a time resolution of 30 ms. The single-particle
	data revealed that U1 snRNPs occurred in small clusters that colocalized
	with speckles. In the clusters, U1 snRNPs resided for a mean decay
	time of 84 ms before leaving the optical slice in the direction of
	the optical axis, which corresponded to a mean effective diffusion
	coefficient of 1 microm(2)/s. An analysis of the trajectories of
	single U1 snRNPs revealed that at least three kinetic classes of
	low, medium, and high mobility were present. Moreover, the mean square
	displacements of these fractions were virtually independent of time,
	suggesting arrays of binding sites. The results substantiate the
	view that nuclear speckles are not rigid structures but highly dynamic
	domains characterized by a rapid turnover of U1 snRNPs and other
	splicing factors.},

@article{Kuo1991,
	Abstract = {Our detailed measurements of the movements of kinesin- and dynein-coated
	latex beads have revealed several important features of the motors
	which underlie basic mechanical aspects of the mechanisms of motor
	movements. Kinesin-coated beads will move along the paths of individual
	microtubule protofilaments with high fidelity and will pause at 4
	nm intervals along the microtubule axis under low ATP conditions.
	In contrast, cytoplasmic dynein-coated beads move laterally across
	many protofilaments as they travel along the microtubule, without
	any regular pauses, suggesting that the movements of kinesin-coated
	beads are not an artefact of the method. These kinesin bead movements
	suggest a model for kinesin movement in which the two heads walk
	along an individual protofilament in a hand-over-hand fashion. A
	free head would only be able to bind to the next forward tubulin
	subunit on the protofilament and its binding would pull off the trailing
	head to start the cycle again. This model is consistent with the
	observed cooperativity between the heads and with the movement by
	single dimeric molecules. Several testable predictions of the model
	are that kinesin should be able to bind to both alpha and beta tubulin
	and that the length of the neck region of the molecule should control
	the off-axis motility. In this article, we describe the technology
	for measuring nanometer-level movements and the force generated by
	the kinesin molecule.},

	The trajectories of the receptor molecules obtained by SPT were analyzed

	Abstract = {A time-resolved microscope fluorimeter based on a synchroscan streak
	camera and a fast pulsed laser system has been developed to measure
	the fluorescence lifetime decay under the fluorescence microscope.
	This system allows one to measure the nanosecond fluorescence lifetimes
	of fluorophores in a small spot (0.8-6.3 microns diameter) in single
	cultured cells under a fluorescence microscope, while the cells are
	being viewed under a high-power objective lens. A signal acquisition
	time between a second and a minute was usually sufficient to obtain
	fluorescence decay curves with good quality for 10(3)-10(5) fluorophores
	localized in 1 microns 2 domain. A signal-to-noise ratio better than
	30 was obtained for approximately 30,000 fluorescein-labeled band
	3 molecules in a 2 microns 2 region in a single human erythrocyte
	ghost after signal accumulation for 30 s. The measured lifetimes
	for a variety of fluorescent probes attached to proteins in solution
	and lipids in liposomes showed a good agreement with those measured
	in a cuvette under standard conditions by time-correlated single
	photon counting. With the development of this instrument, microscope
	fluorimetry has become a practical, straightforward, quantitative
	technique for investigation of molecular processes in single cells
	in culture. Time-resolved microscope fluorimetry has been applied
	to observe fusion of liposomes in vitro and that of endosomes in
	single cells by monitoring resonance energy transfer. Inspection
	of individual liposomes and endosomes revealed the extent of fusion
	for each vesicle. Since the use of time-resolved microscope fluorimetry
	eliminates the need for subcellular fractionation or the complex
	correction procedures in steady-state microfluorimetry, it greatly
	simplifies the assay for endosome fusion in vivo. The results showed
	that extensive fusion of sequentially formed endosomes takes place
	all over the cell matrix in cultured cells. This suggests that extensive
	fusion with incoming endosomes takes place in many endosomal compartments,
	possibly sorting organelles, or that the early endosomes fuse with
	the preexisting network of tubular cisternae of the endosomal compartment
	at many points in the network. It is concluded that time-resolved
	microscope fluorimetry is a powerful noninvasive technique for studies
	of in situ biochemistry and biophysics using cells and tissues.},

	Abstract = {Cadherin receptors are key morphoregulatory molecules during development.
	To dissect their mode of action, we developed an approach based on
	the use of myogenic C2 cells and beads coated with an Ncad-Fc ligand,
	allowing us to mimic cadherin-mediated adhesion. We used optical
	tweezers and video microscopy to investigate the dynamics of N-cadherin
	anchoring within the very first seconds of bead-cell contact. The
	analysis of the bead movement by single-particle tracking indicated
	that N-cadherin molecules were freely diffusive in the first few
	seconds after bead binding. The beads rapidly became diffusion-restricted
	and underwent an oriented rearward movement as a result of N-cadherin
	anchoring to the actin cytoskeleton. The kinetics of anchoring were
	dependent on ligand density, suggesting that it was an inducible
	process triggered by active cadherin recruitment. This anchoring
	was inhibited by the dominant negative form of Rac1, but not that
	of Cdc42. The Rac1 mutant had no effect on cell contact formation
	or cadherin-catenin complex recruitment, but did inhibit actin recruitment.
	Our results suggest that cadherin anchoring to the actin cytoskeleton
	is an adhesion-triggered, Rac1-regulated process enabling the transduction
	of mechanical forces across the cell membrane; they uncover novel
	aspects of the action of cadherins in cell sorting, cell migration,

	Abstract = {Culture of dispersed smooth muscle cells is known to cause rapid modulation
	from the contractile to the synthetic cellular phenotype. However,
	organ culture of smooth muscle tissue, with maintained extracellular
	matrix and cell-cell contacts, may facilitate maintenance of the
	contractile phenotype. To test the influence of culture conditions,
	structural, functional, and biochemical properties of rat tail arterial
	rings were investigated after culture. Rings were cultured for 4
	days in the absence and presence of 10% FCS and then mounted for
	physiological experiments. Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i))
	after stimulation with norepinephrine was similar in rings cultured
	with and without FCS, whereas force development after FCS was decreased
	by >50%. The difference persisted after permeabilization with beta-escin.
	These effects were associated with the presence of vasoconstrictors
	in FCS and were dissociated from its growth-stimulatory action. FCS
	treatment increased lactate production but did not affect ATP, ADP,
	or AMP contents. The contents of actin and myosin were decreased
	by culture but similar for all culture conditions. There was no effect
	of FCS on calponin contents or myosin SM1/SM2 isoform composition,
	nor was there any appearance of nonmuscle myosin. FCS-stimulated
	rings showed evidence of cell degeneration not found after culture
	without FCS or with FCS + verapamil (1 microM) to lower [Ca(2+)](i).
	The decreased force-generating ability after culture with FCS is
	thus associated with increased [Ca(2+)](i) during culture and not
	primarily caused by growth-associated modulation of cells from the
	contractile to the synthetic phenotype.},

	Abstract = {A hybrid protein, tPA/GFP, consisting of rat tissue plasminogen activator
	(tPA) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed in PC12 cells
	and used to study the distribution, secretory behavior, and dynamics
	of secretory granules containing tPA in living cells with a neuronal
	phenotype. High-resolution images demonstrate that tPA/GFP has a
	growth cone-biased distribution in differentiated cells and that
	tPA/GFP is transported in granules of the regulated secretory pathway
	that colocalize with granules containing secretogranin II. Time-lapse
	images of secretion reveal that secretagogues induce substantial
	loss of cellular tPA/GFP fluorescence, most importantly from growth
	cones. Time-lapse images of the axonal transport of granules containing
	tPA/GFP reveal a surprising complexity to granule dynamics. Some
	granules undergo canonical fast axonal transport; others move somewhat
	more slowly, especially in highly fluorescent neurites. Most strikingly,
	granules traffic bidirectionally along neurites to an extent that
	depends on granule accumulation, and individual granules can reverse
	their direction of motion. The retrograde component of this bidirectional
	transport may help to maintain cellular homeostasis by transporting
	excess tPA/GFP back toward the cell body. The results presented here
	provide a novel view of the axonal transport of secretory granules.
	In addition, the results suggest that tPA is targeted for regulated
	secretion from growth cones of differentiated cells, strategically
	positioning tPA to degrade extracellular barriers or to activate
	other barrier-degrading proteases during axonal elongation.},

	Abstract = {Haptokinetic cell migration across surfaces is mediated by adhesion
	receptors including beta1 integrins and CD44 providing adhesion to
	extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands such as collagen and hyaluronan
	(HA), respectively. Little is known, however, about how such different
	receptor systems synergize for cell migration through three-dimensionally
	(3-D) interconnected ECM ligands. In highly motile human MV3 melanoma
	cells, both beta1 integrins and CD44 are abundantly expressed, support
	migration across collagen and HA, respectively, and are deposited
	upon migration, whereas only beta1 integrins but not CD44 redistribute
	to focal adhesions. In 3-D collagen lattices in the presence or absence
	of HA and cross-linking chondroitin sulfate, MV3 cell migration and
	associated functions such as polarization and matrix reorganization
	were blocked by anti-beta1 and anti-alpha2 integrin mAbs, whereas
	mAbs blocking CD44, alpha3, alpha5, alpha6, or alphav integrins showed
	no effect. With use of highly sensitive time-lapse videomicroscopy
	and computer-assisted cell tracking techniques, promigratory functions
	of CD44 were excluded. 1) Addition of HA did not increase the migratory

	after blocking or activation of beta1 integrins was not restored

	Abstract = {The majority of active transport in the cell is driven by three classes
	of molecular motors: the kinesin and dynein families that move toward
	the plus-end and minus-end of microtubules, respectively, and the
	unconventional myosin motors that move along actin filaments. Each
	class of motor has different properties, but in the cell they often
	function together. In this review we summarize what is known about
	their single-molecule properties and the possibilities for regulation
	of such properties. In view of new results on cytoplasmic dynein,
	we attempt to rationalize how these different classes of motors might
	work together as part of the intracellular transport machinery. We
	propose that kinesin and myosin are robust and highly efficient transporters,
	but with somewhat limited room for regulation of function. Because
	cytoplasmic dynein is less efficient and robust, to achieve function
	comparable to the other motors it requires a number of accessory
	proteins as well as multiple dyneins functioning together. This necessity
	for additional factors, as well as dynein's inherent complexity,
	in principle allows for greatly increased control of function by

@article{Marshall1997,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural studies of fixed cells have revealed that interphase
	chromosomes are highly organized into specific arrangements in the
	nucleus, and have led to a picture of the nucleus as a static structure
	with immobile chromosomes held in fixed positions, an impression
	apparently confirmed by recent photobleaching studies. Functional
	studies of chromosome behavior, however, suggest that many essential
	processes, such as recombination, require interphase chromosomes
	to move around within the nucleus. RESULTS: To reconcile these contradictory
	views, we exploited methods for tagging specific chromosome sites
	in living cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with green fluorescent
	protein and in Drosophila melanogaster with fluorescently labeled
	topoisomerase ll. Combining these techniques with submicrometer single-particle
	tracking, we directly measured the motion of interphase chromatin,
	at high resolution and in three dimensions. We found that chromatin
	does indeed undergo significant diffusive motion within the nucleus,
	but this motion is constrained such that a given chromatin segment
	is free to move within only a limited subregion of the nucleus. Chromatin
	diffusion was found to be insensitive to metabolic inhibitors, suggesting
	that it results from classical Brownian motion rather than from active
	motility. Nocodazole greatly reduced chromatin confinement, suggesting
	a role for the cytoskeleton in the maintenance of nuclear architecture.
	CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that chromatin is free to undergo substantial
	Brownian motion, but that a given chromatin segment is confined to
	a subregion of the nucleus. This constrained diffusion is consistent
	with a highly defined nuclear architecture, but also allows enough
	motion for processes requiring chromosome motility to take place.
	These results lead to a model for the regulation of chromosome interactions
	by nuclear architecture.},

	have become the focus of recent research. We report apparent subdiffusion,
	observed via single particle tracking (SPT), in a homogeneous system
	that only allows normal diffusion (a DMPC monolayer in the fluid
	state). The apparent subdiffusion arises from slight errors in finding
	the actual particle position due to noise inherent in all experimental
	SPT systems. A model is presented that corrects this artifact, and
	predicts the time scales after which the effect becomes negligible.
	The techniques and results presented in this paper should be of use
	in all SPT experiments studying normal and anomalous diffusion.},

	Abstract = {Many cells display dramatically different morphologies when migrating
	in 3D matrices vs. on planar substrata. How these differences arise
	and the implications they have on cell migration are not well understood.
	To address these issues, we examined the locomotive structure and
	behavior of bovine aortic endothelial cells (ECs) either inside 3D
	collagen gels or on 2D surfaces. Using time-lapse imaging, immunofluorescence,
	and confocal microscopy, we identified key morphological differences
	between ECs in 3D collagen gels vs. on 2D substrata, and also demonstrated
	important functional similarities. In 3D matrices, ECs formed cylindrical
	branching pseudopodia, while on 2D substrata they formed wide flat
	lamellae. Three distinct cytoplasmic zones were identified in both
	conditions: (i) a small, F-actin-rich, rapidly moving peripheral
	zone, (ii) a larger, more stable, intermediate zone characterized
	by abundant microtubules and small organelles, and (iii) a locomotively
	inert central zone rich in microtubules, and containing the larger
	organelles. There were few differences between 2D and 3D cells in
	the content and behavior of their peripheral and central zones, whereas
	major differences were seen in the shape and types of movements displayed
	by the intermediate zone, which appeared critical in distributing
	cell-matrix adhesions and directing cytoplasmic flow. This morphological
	and functional delineation of cytoplasmic zones provides a conceptual
	framework for understanding differences in the behavior of cells
	in 3D and 2D environments, and indicates that cytoskeletal structure
	and dynamics in the relatively uncharacterized intermediate zone
	may be particularly important in cell motility in general.},

@article{Mastro1984,
	Abstract = {Electron spin resonance was used to measure the diffusion of a small
	(Mr 170) spin label in the aqueous cytoplasm of mammalian cells.
	Translational and rotational motion were determined from the same
	spectra. Based on measurements made in model systems, it was hypothesized
	that calculations of the apparent viscosity from either rotational
	or translational motion would distinguish between the effects of
	cytoplasmic viscosity or cytoplasmic structure on diffusion. The
	diffusion coefficient calculated from spin label collision frequency,
	averaged 3.3 X 10(-6) cm2/sec in several cell lines. It was greater
	in growing cells and in cells treated with cytochalasin B than in
	quiescent cells. The viscosity of the cytoplasm calculated from the
	translational diffusion coefficient or the rotational correlation
	time was 2.0-3.0 centipoise (1 P = 0.1 Pa X sec), about 2-3 times
	that of the spin label in water. Therefore, over the dimensions measured
	by the technique, 50-100 A, solvent viscosity appears to be the major
	determinant of particle movement in cells under physiological conditions.
	However, when cells were subjected to hypertonic conditions, the
	translational motion decreased by 67%, while the rotational motion
	changed less than 20%. These data suggested that the decrease in
	cell volume under hypertonic conditions was accompanied by an increase
	in cytoplasmic barriers and a decrease in the spacing between existing
	components. In addition, a comparison of reported values for diffusion
	of a variety of molecules in water and in cells indicates that cytoplasmic
	structure plays an important role in the diffusion of proteins such

@article{Mayer2004,
	Abstract = {Tumor cell invasion requires coordinated cell adhesion to an extracellular
	matrix (ECM) substrate at the leading edge and concomitant detachment
	at the cell rear. Known detachment mechanisms include the slow sliding
	of focal contacts, the detachment of adhesion receptors by affinity
	and avidity regulation, as well as the shedding of adhesion receptors,
	most notably integrins. In highly invasive melanoma cells migrating
	within 3D collagen matrices, beta1 integrins and CD44 are released
	upon retraction of the trailing edge, together with ripping-off complete
	cell fragments to become deposited along the migration trail of remodeled
	matrix. Cell fragments reach a size up to 12 microm in diameter,
	contain cytoplasm and occasionally polymerized actin enclosed by
	intact cell membrane including surface beta1 integrins, but do not
	include nuclear material. The release of cell fragments was migration
	dependent, as impairment of motility by a blocking anti-beta1 integrin
	antibody also blocked cell particle release. Invasion-associated
	deposition of cell fragments combines the secretory-type release
	of vesicles with a physical mechanism of rear retraction and migration
	efficiency. The deposition of cell fragments may further represent
	a disregulated detachment strategy with implications for neoplastic

	Abstract = {To track the behavior of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 in the

	the cytoplasm and accumulated in the perinuclear region, often near
	the microtubule-organizing center. Further studies show that HIV

@article{Morris1993,
	Abstract = {Although small molecules such as ATP diffuse freely in the cytosol,
	many types of cells nonetheless position their mitochondria in regions
	of intense ATP consumption. We reasoned that in the highly elongated
	axonal processes of growing neurons in culture, the active growth
	cone would form a focus of ATP consumption so distant from the cell
	body as to require the positioning of mitochondria nearby via regulated
	axonal transport. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the distribution
	and transport behavior of mitochondria in live, aerobically respiring
	chick sympathetic neurons. We found that in the distal region of
	actively growing axons, the distribution of mitochondria was highly
	skewed toward the growth cone, with a sevenfold higher density in
	the region immediately adjacent to the growth cone than in the region
	100 microns away. When axonal outgrowth was blocked by substratum-associated
	barriers or mild cytochalasin E treatment, the gradient of mitochondrial
	distribution collapsed as mitochondria exited retrogradely from the
	distal region, becoming uniformly distributed along the axon within
	one hour. Analysis of individual mitochondrial behaviors revealed
	that mitochondrial movement everywhere was bidirectional but balanced
	so that net transport was anterograde in growing axons and retrograde
	in blocked axons. This reversal in net transport derived from two
	separate modulations of mitochondrial movement. First, moving mitochondria
	underwent a transition to a persistently stationary state in the
	region of active growth cones that was reversed when growth cone
	activity was halted. Second, the fraction of time that mitochondria
	spent moving anterogradely was sharply reduced in non-growing axons.
	Together, these could account for the formation of gradients of mitochondria
	in growing axons and their dissipation when outgrowth was blocked.
	This regulated transport behavior was not dependent upon the ability
	of mitochondria to produce ATP. Our data indicate that mitochondria
	possess distinct motor activities for both directions of movement
	and that mitochondrial transport in axons is regulated by both recruitment
	between stationary and moving states, and direct regulation of the
	anterograde motor.},

	the "immunological synapse." Our understanding of the steps leading
	up to this formation has been limited by the absence of tools for
	analyzing 3D surfaces and surface distributions as they change over
	time. Here we use a 3D fluorescence quantitation method to show that
	T cell receptors are recruited in bulk within the first minute after
	the onset of activation and with velocities ranging from 0.04 to
	0.1 microm/s; a speed significantly greater than unrestricted diffusion.
	Our method reveals a second feature of this reorientation: a conformational
	change as the T cell pushes more total membrane into the interface
	creating a larger contact area for additional receptors. Analysis
	of individual T cell receptor velocities using a single-particle
	tracking method confirms our velocity measurement. This method should
	permit the quantitation of other dynamic membrane events and the
	associated movement of cell-surface molecules.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a convenient methodology for patterning substrates
	for cell culture that allows the positions and dimensions of attached
	cells to be controlled. The method uses self-assembled monolayers
	(SAMs) of terminally substituted alkanethiolates (R(CH2)11-15S-)
	adsorbed on optically transparent films of gold or silver to control
	the properties of the substrates. SAMs terminated in methyl groups
	adsorb protein and SAMs terminated in oligo(ethylene glycol) groups
	resist entirely the adsorption of protein. This methodology uses
	microcontact printing (microCP)-an experimentally simple, nonphotolithographic
	process-to pattern the formation of SAMs at the micrometer scale;
	microCP uses an elastomeric stamp having at its surface a pattern
	in relief to transfer an alkanethiol to a surface of gold or silver
	in the same pattern. Patterned SAMs having hydrophobic, methyl-terminated
	lines 10, 30, 60, and 90 microm in width and separated by protein-resistant
	regions 120 microm in width were prepared and coated with fibronectin;
	the protein adsorbed only to the methyl-terminated regions. Bovine
	capillary endothelial cells attached only to the fibronectin-coated,
	methyl-terminated regions of the patterned SAMs. The cells remained
	attached to the SAMs and confined to the pattern of underlying SAMs
	for at least 5-7 days. Because the substrates are optically transparent,
	cells could be visualized by inverted microscopy and by fluorescence
	microscopy after fixing and staining with fluorescein-labeled phalloidin.},

	Abstract = {How site-specific transcription factors scan the genome to locate
	their target sites is a fundamental question in gene regulation.
	The in vivo binding interactions of several different transcription
	factors with chromatin have been investigated recently using quantitative
	fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). These analyses
	have yielded significantly different estimates of both the binding
	rates and the number of predicted binding states of the respective
	transcription factors. We show here that these discrepancies are
	not due to fundamental differences among the site-specific transcription
	factors, but rather arise from errors in FRAP modeling. The two principal
	errors are a neglect of diffusion's role and an oversimplified approximation
	of the photobleach profile. Accounting for these errors by developing
	a revised FRAP protocol eliminates most of the previous discrepancies
	in the binding estimates for the three different transcription factors
	analyzed here. The new estimates predict that for each of the three
	transcription factors, approximately 75% of the molecules are freely
	diffusing within the nucleus, whereas the remainder is bound with
	an average residence time of approximately 2.5 s to a single type
	of chromatin binding site. Such consistent predictions for three
	different molecules suggest that many site-specific transcription
	factors may exhibit similar in vivo interactions with native chromatin.},

	The first part of the experiment confirms the feasibility of introducing

	Abstract = {CD44 is a major cell surface adhesion molecule for hyaluronan, a component
	of the extracellular matrix, and is implicated in tumor metastasis
	and invasion. We reported previously that hyaluronan oligosaccharides
	induce CD44 cleavage from tumor cells. Here we show that engagement
	of CD44 promotes CD44 cleavage and tumor cell migration, both of
	which were suppressed by a metalloproteinase inhibitor KB-R7785 and
	tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) but not by TIMP-2.
	We also present evidence that blockade of metalloproteinase-disintegrin
	ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) by RNA interference
	suppresses CD44 cleavage induced by its ligation. Engagement of CD44
	concurrently induced activation of the small GTPase Rac1 and led
	to drastic changes in cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton with
	redistribution of CD44 to newly generated membrane ruffling areas.
	A fluorescence resonance energy transfer approach to visualize GTP-bound
	Rac1 in living cells revealed the localization of the active Rac1
	in the leading edge of the membrane ruffling areas upon ligation
	of CD44. Taken together, our results indicate that the cleavage of
	CD44 catalyzed by ADAM10 is augmented by the intracellular signaling
	elicited by engagement of CD44, through Rac-mediated cytoskeletal
	rearrangement, and suggest that CD44 cleavage contributes to the
	migration and invasion of tumor cells.},

	Abstract = {We have previously used the asialoglycoprotein receptor system to
	elucidate the pathway of hepatocytic processing of ligands such as

	vesicles bind to and travel along microtubules under the control
	of molecular motors such as cytoplasmic dynein. We now report reconstitution
	of this process in vitro with the use of a microscope assay to observe
	the interaction of early endocytic vesicles containing fluorescent

	endosomes bind to microtubules and translocate along them in the
	presence of ATP. This represents the first time that mammalian endosomes
	containing a well-characterized ligand have been directly observed
	to translocate on microtubules in vitro. The endosome movement does
	not require cytosol or exogenous motor protein, is oscillatory, and
	is directed toward the plus and minus ends at equal frequencies.
	We also observe endosomes being stretched in opposite directions
	along microtubules, suggesting that microtubules could provide a

	Abstract = {Restricted expression of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule
	(ALCAM) by hematopoietic cells suggests an important role in the
	immune system and hematopoiesis. To get insight into the mechanisms
	that control ALCAM-mediated adhesion we have investigated homotypic
	ALCAM-ALCAM interactions. Here, we demonstrate that the cytoskeleton
	regulates ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion because inhibition of actin
	polymerization by cytochalasin D (CytD) strongly induces homotypic
	ALCAM-ALCAM interactions. This induction of cell adhesion is likely
	due to clustering of ALCAM at the cell surface, which is observed
	after CytD treatment. Single-particle tracking demonstrated that
	the lateral mobility of ALCAM in the cell membrane is increased 30-fold
	after CytD treatment. In contrast, both surface distribution and
	adhesion of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ALCAM mutant
	are insensitive to CytD, despite the increase in lateral mobility
	of GPI-ALCAM upon CytD treatment. This demonstrates that clustering
	of ALCAM is essential for cell adhesion, whereas enhanced diffusion
	of ALCAM alone is not sufficient for cluster formation. In addition,
	upon ligand binding, both free diffusion and the freely dragged distance
	of wild-type ALCAM, but not of GPI-ALCAM, are reduced over time,
	suggesting strengthening of the cytoskeleton linkage. From these
	findings we conclude that activation of ALCAM-mediated adhesion is

	the regulation of focal adhesion formation and cytoskeletal tension
	by intercellular VE-cadherin engagement, and the molecular mechanism
	by which this occurs. Increasing the density of endothelial cells
	to increase cell-cell contact decreased focal adhesions by decreasing
	cell spreading. This contact inhibition of cell spreading was blocked
	by disrupting VE-cadherin engagement with an adenovirus encoding
	dominant negative VE-cadherin. When changes in cell spreading were
	prevented by culturing cells on a micropatterned substrate, VE-cadherin-mediated
	cell-cell contact paradoxically increased focal adhesion formation.
	We show that VE-cadherin engagement mediates each of these effects
	by inducing both a transient and sustained activation of RhoA. Both
	the increase and decrease in cell-matrix adhesion were blocked by
	disrupting intracellular tension and signaling through the Rho-ROCK
	pathway. In all, these findings demonstrate that VE-cadherin signals

	Abstract = {Most stored neuropeptide cannot be released from nerve terminals suggesting
	the existence of a refractory pool of dense core vesicles (DCVs).
	Past fluorescence photobleaching recovery, single particle tracking
	and release experiments suggested that the refractory neuropeptide
	pool corresponds to a distinct immobile fraction of cytoplasmic DCVs.
	However, tracking of hundreds of individual green fluorescent protein-labeled
	neuropeptidergic vesicles by wide-field or evanescent-wave microscopy
	shows that a separate immobile fraction is not evident. Instead,
	the DCV diffusion coefficient (D) distribution is unusually broad
	and asymmetric. Furthermore, the distribution shifts with a release
	facilitator. This unexpected variation, which could reflect heterogeneity
	among vesicles or in their medium, is shown to generate the appearance
	of a regulated refractory neuropeptide pool.},

	Abstract = {Using optical tweezers and single particle tracking, we have revealed
	the motion of a single protein, the lambda-receptor, in the outer

	is very low, thus enabling the attachment of a streptavidin-coated
	bead binding specifically to a single biotinylated lambda-receptor.
	The bead was used as a handle for the optical tweezers and as a marker

	Abstract = {A new method of fluorescence microscopy for cell imaging has been
	developed that takes advantage of the spatial variations of fluorescence
	lifetimes in single cells as a source of image contrast, and thus
	it is named "fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (flimscopy)".
	Since time-resolved fluorescence measurements are sensitive to molecular
	dynamics and interactions, flimscopy allows the molecular information
	to be visualized in single cells. In flimscopy measurements, several
	(nanosecond) time-resolved fluorescence images of a sample are obtained
	at various delay times after pulsed laser excitation of the microscope's
	entire field of view. Lifetimes are calculated pixel-by-pixel from
	these time-resolved images, and the spatial variations of the lifetimes
	are then displayed in a pseudocolor format (flimscopy image). The
	total data acquisition time needed to obtain a flimscopy image with
	the diffraction-limited spatial resolution (approximately 250 nm)
	is decreased to just approximately 30 s for approximately 300 fluorescent
	molecules/micron2. This was achieved by developing a high-frequency
	(400 kHz) nanosecond-gating (9 ns full width at half height)-signal
	accumulation system. This technique allows the extent of resonance
	energy transfer to be visualized in single living cells, and is free
	from the errors due to variations in path length, light scattering,
	and the number of fluorophores that necessitate complex corrections
	in steady-state microfluorometry and fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy.
	Flimscopy was applied here to observe the extent of fusion of individual
	endosomes in single cells. Results revealed the occurrence of extensive
	fusion between primary endocytic vesicles and/or sorting endosomes,
	thereby raising the possibility that the biogenesis of sorting endosomes
	involves multiple fusions of primary endocytic vesicles.},

	at discrete and functionally significant domains on the nerve cell
	surface is an important determinant in the integration of synaptic
	inputs. To discern the role that the subunits of the GABA(A)R play
	in determining the receptor's cell surface topography and mobility,
	the alpha1, beta1, beta3, and gamma2s subunits were transfected into
	COS7, HEK293, and PC12 cells and the distribution and cell surface
	mobility of these recombinant receptors were examined. Our results
	show that alpha1 subunits are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum
	while beta1 and beta3 subunits are sorted to the plasma membrane
	where they form clusters. Co-expression and co-assembly of alpha1
	and beta3 subunits result in the rescue of intracellular alpha1 subunits,
	which are transported as alphabeta subunit complexes to the cell
	surface where they formed clusters. Fluorescence photobleach recovery
	and single particle tracking of recombinant receptors show that,

	a cell surface domain. Inclusion of alpha1 in beta3 or beta3gamma2s
	complexes, however, dramatically reduces the receptor's lateral mobility
	in COS 7 and PC12 cells and anchors GABA(A)Rs on the cell surface,
	suggesting the formation of a direct link to a component of the cytoskeleton.
	The mobility of recombinant receptors that include the alpha1 subunit
	mirrors the mobility of GABA(A)Rs on cell bodies and dendrites of

	and probe rotation was isotropic with a single correlation time which
	increased linearly with viscosity in the range 1-3.6 cP. In eggs
	at 22 degrees C, there were single lifetimes (in nanoseconds) of
	3.6 (BCECF), 3.4 (6CF), 3.2 (fluorescein), and 3.3 (calcein). Probe

	Abstract = {A three-dimensional single-particle tracking system was combined with
	an optical trap to investigate the behavior of transmembrane adhesion
	proteins. We exploited this setup to investigate which part of the
	cell adhesion protein LFA-1 forms a connection to the cytoskeleton
	after binding to its ligand ICAM-1. LFA-1 is an integrin consisting
	of an alpha and a beta chain. Thus far, only the cytoplasmic tail
	of the beta chain is known to form a connection to the cytoskeleton.
	We investigated cells that express a mutant form of LFA-1 that lacks
	the complete beta cytoplasmic tail and therefore is not thought to
	bind to the cytoskeleton. Interestingly, single-particle tracking
	measurements using beads coated with the ligand ICAM-1 indicate that
	this mutant form of LFA-1 does not move freely within the cell membrane,
	suggesting that LFA-1 is still connected to the cytoskeleton network.
	This finding is strongly supported by the observation that LFA-1
	exhibits a more diffusive motion when the cytoskeleton network is
	disrupted and confirmed by the optical trap measurements used to
	force the proteins to move through the membrane. Collectively, our
	findings suggest that the interaction of LFA-1 with the cytoskeleton
	cannot solely be attributed to the cytoplasmic part of the beta chain.},

	fluctuations of individual flexible polymer molecules. In single-particle
	tracking (SPT), one end of the polymer molecule is tethered to an
	immobile substratum. A microsphere attached to the other end serves
	as an optical marker. The conformational fluctuations of the polymer
	molecule can be measured by optical microscopy via the motion of
	the microsphere. The bead-and-spring theory for polymer dynamics
	is further developed to account for the microsphere, and together
	the measurement and the theory yield quantitative information about
	molecular conformations and dynamics under nonperturbing conditions.
	Applying the method to measurements carried out on DNA molecules
	provides information complementary to recent studies of single DNA

	with the theoretical analysis presented here creates a powerful tool

	Abstract = {Inflammatory disease is initiated by leukocytes (white blood cells)
	rolling along the inner surface lining of small blood vessels called
	postcapillary venules. Studying the number and velocity of rolling
	leukocytes is essential to understanding and successfully treating
	inflammatory diseases. Potential inhibitors of leukocyte recruitment
	can be screened by leukocyte rolling assays and successful inhibitors
	validated by intravital microscopy. In this paper, we present an
	active contour or snake-based technique to automatically track the
	movement of the leukocytes. The novelty of the proposed method lies
	in the energy functional that constrains the shape and size of the
	active contour. This paper introduces a significant enhancement over
	existing gradient-based snakes in the form of a modified gradient
	vector flow. Using the gradient vector flow, we can track leukocytes
	rolling at high speeds that are not amenable to tracking with the
	existing edge-based techniques. We also propose a new energy-based
	implicit sampling method of the points on the active contour that
	replaces the computationally expensive explicit method. To enhance
	the performance of this shape and size constrained snake model, we
	have coupled it with Kalman filter so that during coasting (when
	the leukocytes are completely occluded or obscured), the tracker
	may infer the location of the center of the leukocyte. Finally, we
	have compared the performance of the proposed snake tracker with
	that of the correlation and centroid-based trackers. The proposed
	snake tracker results in superior performance measures, such as reduced
	error in locating the leukocyte under tracking and improvements in
	the percentage of frames successfully tracked. For screening and
	drug validation, the tracker shows promise as an automated data collection

	Abstract = {In the past decade, radioactive particle tracking techniques have
	emerged in the field of chemical engineering and have become increasingly
	popular for non-invasive flow mapping of the hydrodynamics in multiphase
	reactors. Based on gamma-ray sensitization of an array of scintillation
	detectors, the Computer Automated Radioactive Particle Tracking (CARPT)
	technique measures flow fields by monitoring the actual motion path
	of a single discrete radioactive flow follower which has the physical
	properties of the phase whose motion is being followed. A limitation
	to the accuracy of CARPT lies in the error associated with the reconstruction
	of the tracer particle position which affects the space-resolution
	capability of the technique. It is of interest, therefore, to minimize
	this error by choosing wisely the best hardware and an optimal configuration
	of CARPT detectors' array. Such choices are currently based on experience,
	without firm scientific basis. In this paper, through theoretical
	modeling and simulation, we describe how the accuracy of a radioactive
	particle tracking setup may be assessed a priori. Through an example
	of a proposed implementation of CARPT on a gas-solids riser, we demonstrate
	how this knowledge can be used for choosing the hardware required
	for the experiment. Finally, we show how the optimal arrangement

	of successive intercompartmental jumps (Sako, Y. and Kusumi, A. 1994.
	J. Cell Biol. 125:1251-1264). In the present study, we characterized
	the properties of intercompartmental boundaries by tagging transferrin
	receptor (TR) with either 210-nm-phi latex or 40-nm-phi colloidal
	gold particles, and by dragging the particle-TR complexes laterally
	along the plasma membrane using laser tweezers. Approximately 90%
	of the TR-particle complexes showed confined-type diffusion with
	a microscopic diffusion coefficient (Dmicro) of approximately 10(-9)
	cm2/s and could be dragged past the intercompartmental boundaries
	in their path by laser tweezers at a trapping force of 0.25 pN for
	gold-tagged TR and 0.8 pN for latex-tagged TR. At lower dragging
	forces between 0.05 and 0.1 pN, particle-TR complexes tended to escape
	from the laser trap at the boundaries, and such escape occurred in
	both the forward and backward directions of dragging. The average
	distance dragged was half of the confined distance of TR, which further
	indicates that particle-TR complexes escape at the compartment boundaries.
	Since variation in the particle size (40 and 210 nm, the particles
	are on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane) hardly affects
	the diffusion rate and behavior of the particle-TR complexes at the
	compartment boundaries, and since treatment with cytochalasin D or
	vinblastin affects the movements of TR (Sako and Kusumi as cited
	above), argument has been advanced that the boundaries are present
	in the cytoplasmic domain. Rebound of the particle-TR complexes when
	they escape from the laser tweezers at the compartment boundaries
	suggests that the boundaries are elastic structures. These results
	are consistent with the proposal that the compartment boundaries
	consist of membrane skeleton or a membrane-associated part of the
	cytoskeleton (membrane skeleton fence model). Approximately 10% of
	TR exhibited slower diffusion (Dmicro approximately 10(-10)-10(-11)
	cm2/s) and binding to elastic structures.},

	Abstract = {Movements of transferrin and alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor molecules
	in the plasma membrane of cultured normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblastic
	cells were investigated by video-enhanced contrast optical microscopy
	with 1.8 nm spatial precision and 33 ms temporal resolution by labeling
	the receptors with the ligand-coated nanometer-sized colloidal gold
	particles. For both receptor species, most of the movement trajectories
	are of the confined diffusion type, within domains of approximately
	0.25 microns2 (500-700 nm in diagonal length). Movement within the
	domains is random with a diffusion coefficient approximately 10(-9)
	cm2/s, which is consistent with that expected for free Brownian diffusion
	of proteins in the plasma membrane. The receptor molecules move from
	one domain to one of the adjacent domains at an average frequency
	of 0.034 s-1 (the residence time within a domain approximately 29
	s), indicating that the plasma membrane is compartmentalized for
	diffusion of membrane receptors and that long-range diffusion is
	the result of successive intercompartmental jumps. The macroscopic
	diffusion coefficients for these two receptor molecules calculated
	on the basis of the compartment size and the intercompartmental jump
	rate are approximately 2.4 x 10(-11) cm2/s, which is consistent with
	those determined by averaging the long-term movements of many particles.
	Partial destruction of the cytoskeleton decreased the confined diffusion
	mode, increased the simple diffusion mode, and induced the directed
	diffusion (transport) mode. These results suggest that the boundaries
	between compartments are made of dynamically fluctuating membrane
	skeletons (membrane-skeleton fence model).},

	Abstract = {The translational movement of E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent cell-cell
	adhesion molecule in the plasma membrane in epithelial cells, and
	the mechanism of its regulation were studied using single particle
	tracking (SPT) and optical tweezers (OT). The wild type (Wild) and
	three types of artificial cytoplasmic mutants of E-cadherin were
	expressed in L-cells, and their movements were compared. Two mutants
	were E-cadherins that had deletions in the COOH terminus and lost
	the catenin-binding site(s) in the COOH terminus, with remaining
	116 and 21 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain (versus 152 amino
	acids for Wild); these are called Catenin-minus and Short-tailed
	in this paper, respectively. The third mutant, called Fusion, is
	a fusion protein between E-cadherin without the catenin-binding site
	and alpha-catenin without its NH2-terminal half. These cadherins
	were labeled with 40-nm phi colloidal gold or 210-nm phi latex particles
	via a monoclonal antibody to the extracellular domain of E-cadherin
	for SPT or OT experiments, respectively. E-cadherin on the dorsal
	cell surface (outside the cell-cell contact region) was investigated.
	Catenin-minus and Short-tailed could be dragged an average of 1.1
	and 1.8 micron by OT (trapping force of 0.8 pN), and exhibited average
	microscopic diffusion coefficients (Dmicro) of 1.2 x 10(-10) and
	2.1 x 10(-10) cm2/s, respectively. Approximately 40% of Wild, Catenin-minus,
	and Short-tailed exhibited confined-type diffusion. The confinement
	area was 0.13 micron2 for Wild and Catenin-minus, while that for
	Short-tailed was greater by a factor of four. In contrast, Fusion
	could be dragged an average of only 140 nm by OT. Average Dmicro
	for Fusion measured by SPT was small (0.2 x 10(-10) cm2/s). These
	results suggest that Fusion was bound to the cytoskeleton. Wild consists
	of two populations; about half behaves like Catenin- minus, and the

	of the wild-type E-cadherin in the plasma membrane are regulated
	via the cytoplasmic domain by (a) tethering to actin filaments through
	catenin(s) (like Fusion) and (b) a corralling effect of the network

	Abstract = {Two-photon excitation laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (2p-LSM)
	was compared with UV-excitation confocal laser scanning fluorescence
	microscopy (UV-CLSM) in terms of three-dimensional (3-D) calcium
	imaging of living cells in culture. Indo-1 was used as a calcium
	indicator. Since the excitation volume is more limited and excitation
	wavelengths are longer in 2p-LSM than in UV-CLSM, 2p-LSM exhibited
	several advantages over UV-CLSM: (1) a lower level of background
	signal by a factor of 6-17, which enhances the contrast by a factor
	of 6-21: (2) a lower rate of photobleaching by a factor of 2-4; (3)
	slightly lower phototoxicity. When 3-D images were repeatedly acquired,
	the calcium concentration determined by UV-CLSM depended strongly
	on the number of data acquisitions and the nuclear regions falsely
	exhibited low calcium concentrations. probably due to an interplay
	of different levels of photobleaching of Indo-1 and autofluorescence,
	while the calcium concentration evaluated by 2p-LSM was stable and
	homogeneous throughout the cytoplasm. The spatial resolution of 2p-LSM
	was worse by 10% in the focal plane and by 30% along the optical
	axis due to the longer excitation wavelength. This disadvantage can
	be overcome by the addition of a confocal pinhole (two-photon excitation
	confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy), which made the
	resolution similar to that in UV-CLSM. These results indicate that
	2p-LSM is preferable for repeated 3-D reconstruction of calcium concentration
	in living cells. In UV-CLSM, 0.18-mW laser power with a 2.6-phi pinhole
	(in normalized optical coordinate) gives better signal-to-noise ratio,
	contrast and resolution than 0.09-mW laser power with a 4.9-phi pinhole.
	However, since the damage to cells and the rate of photobleaching
	is substantially greater under the former condition, it is not suitable
	for repeated acquisition of 3-D images.},

	surfaces of high curvature and complex shape, which are often encountered

	and is shown to be second-order accurate in space and time and of
	high parallel efficiency. It is applied to simulations of diffusion
	on the membrane of endoplasmic reticula (ER) in live cells. Diffusion
	simulations are conducted on geometries reconstructed from real ER
	samples and are compared to fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
	experiments in the same ER samples using the transmembrane protein
	tsO45-VSV-G, C-terminally tagged with green fluorescent protein.
	Such comparisons allow derivation of geometry-corrected molecular
	diffusion constants for membrane components from fluorescence recovery
	after photobleaching data. The results of the simulations indicate
	that the diffusion behavior of molecules in the ER membrane differs
	significantly from the volumetric diffusion of soluble molecules
	in the lumen of the same ER. The apparent speed of recovery differs
	by a factor of approximately 4, even when the molecular diffusion
	constants of the two molecules are identical. In addition, the specific

	Abstract = {This paper presents a computationally efficient, two-dimensional,
	feature point tracking algorithm for the automated detection and
	quantitative analysis of particle trajectories as recorded by video
	imaging in cell biology. The tracking process requires no a priori
	mathematical modeling of the motion, it is self-initializing, it
	discriminates spurious detections, and it can handle temporary occlusion
	as well as particle appearance and disappearance from the image region.
	The efficiency of the algorithm is validated on synthetic video data
	where it is compared to existing methods and its accuracy and precision
	are assessed for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm
	is well suited for video imaging in cell biology relying on low-intensity
	fluorescence microscopy. Its applicability is demonstrated in three
	case studies involving transport of low-density lipoproteins in endosomes,
	motion of fluorescently labeled Adenovirus-2 particles along microtubules,
	and tracking of quantum dots on the plasma membrane of live cells.
	The present automated tracking process enables the quantification
	of dispersive processes in cell biology using techniques such as
	moment scaling spectra.},

	Abstract = {The determination of diffusion coefficients from fluorescence recovery
	data is often complicated by geometric constraints imposed by the
	complex shapes of intracellular compartments. To address this issue,
	diffusion of proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
	is studied using cell biological and computational methods. Fluorescence
	recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments are performed in
	tissue culture cells expressing GFP-KDEL, a soluble, fluorescent
	protein, in the ER lumen. The three-dimensional (3D) shape of the
	ER is determined by confocal microscopy and computationally reconstructed.
	Within these ER geometries diffusion of solutes is simulated using
	the method of particle strength exchange. The simulations are compared
	to experimental FRAP curves of GFP-KDEL in the same ER region. Comparisons
	of simulations in the 3D ER shapes to simulations in open 3D space
	show that the constraints imposed by the spatial confinement result
	in two- to fourfold underestimation of the molecular diffusion constant
	in the ER if the geometry is not taken into account. Using the same
	molecular diffusion constant in different simulations, the observed
	speed of fluorescence recovery varies by a factor of 2.5, depending
	on the particular ER geometry and the location of the bleached area.
	Organelle shape considerably influences diffusive transport and must
	be taken into account when relating experimental photobleaching data
	to molecular diffusion coefficients. This novel methodology combines
	experimental FRAP curves with high accuracy computer simulations
	of diffusion in the same ER geometry to determine the molecular diffusion
	constant of the solute in the particular ER lumen.},

	Abstract = {The lateral mobility of lipids in phospholipid membranes has attracted
	numerous experimental and theoretical studies, inspired by the model
	of Singer and Nicholson (1972. Science, 175:720-731) and the theoretical
	description by Saffman and Delbruck (1975. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
	USA. 72:3111-3113). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
	is used as the standard experimental technique for the study of lateral
	mobility, yielding an ensemble-averaged diffusion constant. Single-particle
	tracking (SPT) and the recently developed single-molecule imaging
	techniques now give access to data on individual displacements of
	molecules, which can be used for characterization of the mobility
	in a membrane. Here we present a new type of analysis for tracking
	data by making use of the probability distribution of square displacements.
	The potential of this new type of analysis is shown for single-molecule
	imaging, which was employed to follow the motion of individual fluorescence-labeled
	lipids in two systems: a fluid-supported phospholipid membrane and
	a solid polymerstabilized phospholipid monolayer. In the fluid membrane,
	a high-mobility component characterized by a diffusion constant of
	4.4 microns2/s and a low-mobility component characterized by a diffusion
	constant of 0.07 micron2/s were identified. It is proposed that the
	latter characterizes the so-called immobile fraction often found
	in FRAP experiments. In the polymer-stabilized system, diffusion
	restricted to corrals of 140 nm was directly visualized. Both examples
	show the potentials of such detailed analysis in combination with
	single-molecule techniques: with minimal interference with the native
	structure, inhomogeneities of membrane mobility can be resolved with
	a spatial resolution of 100 nm, well below the diffraction limit.},

@article{Schernewski2001,
	Abstract = {The large Oder (Szczecin) Lagoon (687 km2) at the German-Polish border,
	close to the Baltic Sea, suffers from severe eutrophication and water
	quality problems due to high discharge of water, nutrients and pollutants
	by the river Oder. Sewage treatment around the lagoon has been very
	much improved during the last years, but large amounts of sewage
	still enter the Oder river. Human pathogenic viruses generally can
	be expected in all surface waters that are affected by municipal
	sewage. There is an increasing awareness that predisposed persons
	can be infected by a few infective units or even a single active
	virus. Another new aspect is, that at least polioviruses attached
	to suspended particles can be infective for weeks and therefore be
	transported over long distances. Therefore, the highest risk of virus
	inputs arise from the large amounts of untreated sewage of the city
	of Szczecin (Poland), which are released into the river Oder and
	transported to the lagoon and the Baltic Sea. Summer tourism is the
	most important economical factor in this coastal region and further
	growth is expected. Human pathogenic viruses might be a serious problem
	for bathing water quality and sustainable summer tourism. The potential
	hazard of virus infections along beaches and shores of the Oder lagoon
	and adjacent parts of the Baltic Sea is evaluated on the basis of
	model simulations and laboratory results. We used two scenarios for
	the Older Lagoon considering free viruses and viruses attached to
	suspended particle matter. The spatial impact of the average virus
	release in the city of Szczecin during summer (bathing period) was
	simulated with a hydrodynamic and particle tracking model. Simulations
	suggest that due to fast inactivation, free viruses in the water
	represent a risk only in the river and near the river mouth. On the
	other hand, viruses attached to suspended matter can affect large
	areas of the eastern, Polish part of the lagoon (Grosses Haff). At
	the same time the accumulation of viruses on suspended particulate
	matter increases the likelihood of an infection after incorporation
	of such a particle. There is no evidence, that there is a risk of
	virus infections in the western part of the lagoon (Kleines Haff)
	or along the outer Baltic Sea coast.},

	Abstract = {The control of neuronal cell position and outgrowth is of fundamental
	interest in the development of applications ranging from cellular
	biosensors to tissue engineering. We have produced rectangular networks
	of functional rat hippocampal neurons on silicon oxide surfaces.
	Attachment and network formation of neurons was guided by a geometrical
	grid pattern of the adhesion peptide PA22-2 which matches in sequence
	a part of the A-chain of laminin. PA22-2 was applied by contact printing
	onto the functionalised silicon oxide surface and was immobilised
	by hetero-bifunctional cross-linking with sulfo-GMBS. Geometric pattern
	matching was achieved by microcontact printing using a polydimethylsiloxane
	(PDMS) stamp. In this way the produced grid pattern ranged from 3
	to 20 microm in line width and from 50 to 100 microm in line distances.
	As shown by atomic force microscopy (AFM), line widths and line distances
	of the peptide pattern differ less than 0.5 microm from the used
	PDMS stamp. The height of the layer of immobilised PA22-2 was approximately
	3.5 nm implying the layer to be monomolecular. Immobilised PA22-2
	was capable of binding anti-PA22-2 antibodies indicating that the
	function of the peptide was not compromised by immobilisation. Rat
	hippocampal neurons, cultured at low density in serum-free medium,
	were applied to the growth matrix of PA22-2-coated substrates and,
	within 1-3 h of culture, formed a network-like pattern that more
	or less matched the printed grid. Reliability and reproducibility
	of neuronal network formation depended on the geometry, line width
	and node diameter of the grid pattern. The immobilised neurons showed
	resting membrane potentials comparable with controls and, already
	after 1 day of culture, were capable of eliciting action potentials.
	The suitability of the immobilised neurons for the study of man-made
	neural networks and for multi-site recordings from a functional neuronal
	network is discussed.},

	patterned, metal-oxide-based surfaces comprising combinations of
	titanium, aluminium, vanadium and niobium were investigated. Single
	metal samples with a homogeneous surface and bimetal samples with
	a surface pattern produced by photolithographic techniques were used.
	The physical and chemical properties of the samples have been extensively

	their properties in terms of cell responses during the initial 24h
	of cell culture. Regarding the cell number and activity there was
	no significant difference between any of the single metal surfaces.
	However the morphology of cells on vanadium surfaces became spindle-like.
	In contrast to the behaviour on single metal samples, cells exhibited
	a pronounced reaction on bimetallic surfaces that contained aluminium.
	Cells tended to stay away from aluminium, which was the least favoured
	metal in all two-metal combinations. An initial cell alignment relative
	to the pattern geometry was detectable after 2h and was fully developed
	after 18h of incubation. The organisation of f-actin and microtubules
	as well as the localisation of vinculin were all more pronounced
	on non-aluminium regions. We hypothesised that the differences in
	cell response could be associated with differences in the adsorption
	of serum proteins onto the various metal oxides. Protein adsorption
	experiments were performed using microscopy in conjunction with immunofluorescent
	stains. They indicated that both fibronectin and albumin adsorption

	Abstract = {Glutamate receptors are clustered at the membrane through interactions
	with intracellular scaffolding proteins and cytoskeletal elements
	but can also be found in intracellular compartments or dispersed

	the different pools of receptors whose dynamic is poorly known. The
	group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is concentrated
	in an annulus around the postsynaptic density but also found in large
	amounts in the extrasynaptic membrane. To analyze the dynamic of

	measurements, and fluorescence recovery to measure the mobility of
	mGluR5. We found that receptor activation increases receptor diffusion,
	whereas the scaffolding protein Homer favors confinement of receptor
	movements within clusters of Homer-mGluR5. However, this stabilization
	is reversible, because even in the presence of Homer, receptors still
	enter and exit from clusters at fast rates. Furthermore, clusters
	themselves are highly dynamic both in their movements and in their
	composition, which can vary within tens of seconds. Thus, exchange

	Abstract = {Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins participate in
	many cell surface functions; however, the molecular associations
	of these lipid-linked proteins within the plasma membrane are not
	well understood. Recent biochemical analyses of detergent insoluble
	membrane fractions have suggested that GPI-anchored proteins may
	be associated with glycosphingolipid (GSL)-enriched domains that
	also contain cholesterol and signaling molecules such as Src family
	kinases and, in some cases, caveolae. The movements of two components
	of the putative GSL-enriched domains, Thy-1, a GPI-anchored protein,
	and GM1, a GSL, were followed with single particle tracking on C3H
	10T1/2 cell surfaces and categorized into four modes of lateral transport,
	fast diffusion, slow anomalous diffusion, diffusion confined to 325-370
	nm diameter regions, and a fraction of molecules that was essentially
	stationary on the 6.6 s time scale. Longer observations (60 s) showed
	that Thy-1 and GM1 are transiently confined for 7-9 s to regions
	averaging 260-330 nm in diameter. Approximately 35-37% of both Thy-1
	and GM1 undergo confined diffusion, whereas only 16% of fluorescein
	phosphatidylethanolamine, a phospholipid analog which is not expected
	to be found in the GSL domains, experience confined diffusion to
	regions averaging approximately 230 nm in diameter. Further, when
	glycosphingolipid expression was reduced approximately 40% with the
	glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol,
	the percentage of trajectories exhibiting confinement and the size
	of the confining domain for Thy-1 were reduced approximately 1.5-fold.
	In contrast, extraction of cells with Triton X-100 leaves the fraction
	of molecules confined and the domain sizes of Thy-1 and GM1 unchanged.
	Our results are consistent with the preferential association of GPI-anchored
	proteins with glycosphingolipid-enriched domains and suggest that
	the confining domains may be the in vivo equivalent of the detergent
	insoluble membrane fractions.},

	Abstract = {The plasma membranes of migrating cells differentiate into at least
	three distinct domains as defined by the laser tweezers and the motile
	behaviour of particles bound to specific membrane glycoproteins.
	These domains are important for steps in the cell migration process.
	First, there is a domain at the leading edge of the lamellipodium
	where preferential attachment of cross-linked glycoproteins to the
	cytoskeleton occurs. The second domain at the rear of the cell is
	differentiated for releasing from substrata and shows decreased support
	of the membrane by the cytoskeleton. The third domain is the highly
	curved region(s) of the plasma membrane wherein certain membrane
	glycoproteins concentrate and is a site for controlling extension
	and attachment. Using single particle tracking and video analysis
	we find that the quantitative differences between plasma membrane
	domains are in the 4-20-fold range at any given time. These values
	are consistent with the rapid fluctuations seen in cell migration
	rates and directions. Over a longer time-scale, cells can possibly
	integrate these selective advantages to give a much higher overall
	fidelity for cell chemotaxis and neuronal path finding.},

@article{Shima1999,
	Abstract = {Membrane traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi
	complex is regulated by two vesicular coat complexes, COPII and COPI.
	COPII has been implicated in the selective packaging of anterograde
	cargo into coated transport vesicles budding from the ER [1]. In
	mammalian cells, these vesicles coalesce to form tubulo-vesicular
	transport complexes (TCs), which shuttle anterograde cargo from the
	ER to the Golgi complex [2] [3] [4]. In contrast, COPI-coated vesicles
	are proposed to mediate recycling of proteins from the Golgi complex
	to the ER [1] [5] [6] [7]. The binding of COPI to COPII-coated TCs
	[3] [8] [9], however, has led to the proposal that COPI binds to
	TCs and specifically packages recycling proteins into retrograde
	vesicles for return to the ER [3] [9]. To test this hypothesis, we
	tracked fluorescently tagged COPI and anterograde-transport markers
	simultaneously in living cells. COPI predominated on TCs shuttling
	anterograde cargo to the Golgi complex and was rarely observed on
	structures moving in directions consistent with retrograde transport.
	Furthermore, a progressive segregation of COPI-rich domains and anterograde-cargo-rich
	domains was observed in the TCs. This segregation and the directed
	motility of COPI-containing TCs were inhibited by antibodies that
	blocked COPI function. These observations, which are consistent with
	previous biochemical data [2] [9], suggest a role for COPI within
	TCs en route to the Golgi complex. By sequestering retrograde cargo
	in the anterograde-directed TCs, COPI couples the sorting of ER recycling
	proteins [10] to the transport of anterograde cargo.},

	Abstract = {The lateral mobility of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was
	examined using single particle tracking (SPT). Various isoforms of
	human NCAM, differing in their ectodomain, their membrane anchorage
	mode, or the size of their cytoplasmic domain, were expressed in
	National Institutes of Health 3T3 cells and C2C12 muscle cells. On
	a 6.6-s time scale, SPT measurements on both transmembrane and glycosylphosphatidylinositol
	(GPI) anchored isoforms of NCAM expressed in 3T3 cells could be classified
	into mobile (Brownian diffusion), slow diffusion, corralled diffusion,
	and immobile subpopulations. On a 90-s time scale, SPT studies in
	C2C12 cells revealed that 40-60% of transfected NCAM was mobile,
	whereas a smaller fraction (approximately 10-30%) experienced much
	slower diffusion. In addition, a fraction of approximately 30% of
	both transfected GPI and transmembrane isoforms and endogenous NCAM
	isoforms in C2C12 cells experienced transient confinement for approximately
	8 s within regions of approximately 300-nm diameter. Diffusion within
	both these and the slow diffusion regions was anomalous, consistent
	with movements through a dense field of obstacles, whereas diffusion
	outside these regions was normal. Thus the membrane appears as a
	mosaic containing regions that permit free diffusion as well as regions
	in which NCAM is transiently confined to small or more extended domains.
	These results, including a large, freely diffusing fraction, similar
	confinement of transmembrane and GPI isoforms, a significant slowly
	diffusing fraction, and relatively large interdomain distances, are
	at some variance with the membrane skeleton fence model (Kusumi and

	Abstract = {One-dimensional models are presented for the macroscopic intracellular
	transport of vesicles and organelles by molecular motors on a network

	is described as a diffusing particle binding intermittently to filaments,
	when it is transported at the motor velocity. Two models are treated
	in detail: 1) a unidirectional model, where only one kind of motor
	is operative and all filaments have the same polarity; and 2) a bidirectional
	model, in which filaments of both polarities exist (for example,
	a randomly polarized actin network for myosin motors) and/or particles
	have plus-end and minus-end motors operating on unipolar filaments
	(kinesin and dynein on microtubules). The unidirectional model provides
	net particle transport in the absence of a concentration gradient.
	A symmetric bidirectional model, with equal mixtures of filament
	polarities or plus-end and minus-end motors of the same characteristics,
	provides rapid transport down a concentration gradient and enhanced
	dispersion of particles from a point source by motor-assisted diffusion.
	Both models are studied in detail as a function of the diffusion
	constant and motor velocity of bound particles, and their rates of
	binding to and detachment from filaments. These models can form the

	Abstract = {Single-particle tracking (SPT) was used to determine the mobility
	characteristics of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I
	molecules at the surface of HeLa cells at 22 degrees C and on different
	time scales. MHC class I was labeled using the Fab fragment of a
	monoclonal antibody (W6/32), covalently bound to either R-phycoerythrin
	or fluorescent microspheres, and the particles were tracked using
	high-sensitivity fluorescence imaging. Analysis of the data for a
	fixed time interval suggests a reasonable fit to a random diffusion
	model. The best fit values of the diffusion coefficient D decreased
	markedly, however, with increasing time interval, demonstrating the
	existence of anomalous diffusion. Further analysis of the data shows
	that the diffusion is anomalous over the complete time range investigated,
	4-300 s. Fitting the results obtained with the R-phycoerythrin probe
	to D = D0talpha-1, where Do is a constant and t is the time, gave
	D0 = (6.7 +/- 4.5) x 10(-11) cm2 s-1 and alpha = 0.49 +/- 0.16. Experiments
	with fluorescent microspheres were less reproducible and gave slower
	anomalous diffusion. The R-phycoerythrin probe is considered more
	reliable for fluorescent SPT because it is small (11 x 8 nm) and
	monovalent. The type of motion exhibited by the class I molecules
	will greatly affect their ability to migrate in the plane of the

	Abstract = {Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is now widely used
	to investigate binding interactions in live cells. Although various
	idealized solutions have been identified for the reaction-diffusion
	equations that govern FRAP, there has been no comprehensive analysis
	or systematic approach to serve as a guide for extracting binding
	information from an arbitrary FRAP curve. Here we present a complete
	solution to the FRAP reaction-diffusion equations for either single
	or multiple independent binding interactions, and then relate our
	solution to the various idealized cases. This yields a coherent approach
	to extract binding information from FRAP data which we have applied
	to the question of transcription factor mobility in the nucleus.
	We show that within the nucleus, the glucocorticoid receptor is transiently
	bound to a single state, with each molecule binding on average 65
	sites per second. This rapid sampling is likely to be important in
	finding a specific promoter target sequence. Further we show that
	this predominant binding state is not the nuclear matrix, as some
	studies have suggested. We illustrate how our analysis provides several
	self-consistency checks on a FRAP fit. We also define constraints
	on what can be estimated from FRAP data, show that diffusion should
	play a key role in many FRAP recoveries, and provide tools to test
	its contribution. Overall our approach establishes a more general
	framework to assess the role of diffusion, the number of binding
	states, and the binding constants underlying a FRAP recovery.},

	3T3 fibroblasts, human mononuclear cells, Sarcoma-180 tumor cells,
	Chinese hamster ovary cells, plant cells from Digitalis lanata, stamen

	Space-resolved measurements of cytoplasmic viscosity were carried
	out by using an experimental set-up wherein a picosecond laser system

	of this set-up was approximately 1.0 micron, and reliable dynamic
	fluorescence measurements could be obtained from 10(2) to 10(3) fluorescent

	fraction (approximately 70%) of kiton red was in the free form. Fluorescence
	anisotropy decay of kiton red in cells was analyzed by a two population
	(free and bound) model. The microviscosity of cytoplasm was estimated
	from the anisotropy decay kinetics of the free probe. It was found
	that the cytoplasmic viscosity is dependent on both the cell type
	and spatial location within a cell. Furthermore, both the average
	value of viscosity and spatial variation within a cell were larger
	in the plant cells when compared to the animal cells. Model studies

	Abstract = {Two alternative particle image velocimetry (PIV) methods have been
	developed, applying laser light sheet illumination of particle-seeded
	flows around marine organisms. Successive video images, recorded
	perpendicular to a light sheet parallel to the main stream, were
	digitized and processed to map the flow velocity in two-dimensional
	planes. In particle tracking velocimetry (PTV), displacements of
	single particles in two subsequent images were determined semi-automatically,
	resulting in flow diagrams consisting of non-uniformly distributed
	velocity vectors. Application of grid-cell averaging resulted in
	flow field diagrams with uniform vector distribution. In sub-image
	correlation PIV (SCPIV), repetitive convolution filtering of small
	sub-areas of two subsequent images resulted in automatic determination
	of cross-correlation peaks, yielding flow field diagrams with regularly
	spaced velocity vectors. In both PTV and SCPIV, missing values, caused
	by incomplete particle displacement information in some areas of
	the images or due to rejection of some erroneous vectors by the vector
	validation procedure, were interpolated using a two-dimensional spline
	interpolation technique. The resultant vector flow fields were used
	to study the spatial distribution of velocity, spatial acceleration,
	vorticity, strain and shear. These flow fields could also be used
	to test for flow in the third dimension by studying the divergence,
	and to detect the presence and location of vortices. The results
	offer detailed quantitative descriptions of the flow morphology and
	can be used to assess dissipated energy. The versatile character
	of the technique makes it applicable to a wide range of fluid mechanical

	Abstract = {Transport of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi
	apparatus is mediated by two distinct membrane coat complexes, COPI
	and COPII. Genetic, biochemical and morphological data have accumulated
	into a model which suggests a sequential mode of action with COPII
	mediating the selection of cargo and formation of transport vesicles
	at the ER membrane for ER-to-Golgi transport and COPI mediating recycling
	of the transport machinery from post-ER membranes. To test this transport
	model directly in vivo, and to study the precise temporal sequence
	of COPI and COPII action in ER-to-Golgi transport, we have used time
	lapse microscopy of living cells to visualise simultaneously the
	dynamics of COPII and COPI, as well as COPII and GFP tagged secretory
	markers in living cells. The majority of COPII labelling appears
	tightly associated with ER membranes that move only within a limited
	area (less than 2 microm). Secretory cargo segregates from these
	sites and is then transported to the Golgi apparatus without any
	apparent association with COPII. COPI-coated transport complexes
	are seen to form adjacent to the COPII sites on the ER before segregating
	and moving directionally towards the Golgi apparatus. COPII is not

	Abstract = {: Originally designed as position-sensitive detectors for particle
	tracking, silicon drift detectors (SDDs) are now used for high-count
	rate X-ray spectroscopy, operating close to room temperature. Their
	low-capacitance read-node concept places them among the fastest high-resolution
	detector systems. They have been used in a new spectrum of experiments
	in the wide field of X-ray spectroscopy: fluorescent analysis, diffractometry,
	materials analysis, and synchrotron experiments such as X-ray holography
	and element imaging in scanning electron microscopes. The fact that
	the detector system can be used at room temperature with good spectroscopic
	performance and at -10 degrees C with excellent energy resolution,
	avoiding liquid nitrogen for cooling and high-quality vacuum, guarantees
	a large variety of new applications, independent of the laboratory
	environment. A brief description of the device principles is followed
	by basics on low noise amplification. The performance results of
	a complete detector system are presented as well as some dedicated
	applications already realized, including use in a surface mapping
	instrument and use of a "mini-spectrometer" for the analysis of works
	of art. Fully depleted pn-charge-coupled devices (pn-CCDs) have been
	fabricated for the European X-ray Multi-Mirror mission (XMM) and
	the German X-ray satellite ABRIXAS, enabling high-speed, low-noise,
	position-resolving X-ray spectroscopy. The detector was designed
	and fabricated with a homogeneously sensitive area of 36 cm2. At
	-70 degrees C it has a noise of 4 e- rms, with a readout time of
	the total focal plane array of 4 msec. The maximum count rate for
	single photon counting was 10(5) cps under flat field conditions.
	In the integration mode, more than 10(9) cps can be detected at 6
	keV. Its position resolution is on the order of 100 microm. The quantum
	efficiency is higher than 90%, ranging from carbon K X-rays (277
	eV) up to 10 keV.},

	that native or taxol-stabilized microtubules (MTs) support alternating
	minus- and plus end-directed movements of cytosolic virus with elementary
	speeds up to 2.6 micrometer/s. No directed movement was observed

	the cell type. Overexpression of p50/dynamitin, which is known to
	affect dynein-dependent minus end-directed vesicular transport, significantly
	reduced the extent and the frequency of minus end-directed migration
	of cytosolic virus, and increased the frequency, but not the extent

	contain domains that organize glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked
	proteins. To define outer membrane barriers, we measured the resistive
	force on membrane bound beads as they were scanned across the plasma
	membrane of HEPA-OVA cells with optical laser tweezers. Beads were
	bound by antibodies to fluorescein-phosphatidylethanolamine (Fl-PE)
	or to the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC class I)
	Qa-2 (a GPI-anchored protein). Two-dimensional scans of resistive
	force showed both occasional, resistive barriers and a velocity-dependent,
	continuous resistance. At the lowest antibody concentration, which
	gave specific binding, the continuous friction coefficient of Qa-2
	was consistent with that observed by single-particle tracking (SPT)
	of small gold particles. At high antibody concentrations, the friction
	coefficient was significantly higher but decreased with increasing
	temperature, addition of deoxycholic acid, or treatment with heparinase
	I. Barriers to lateral movement (>3 times the continuous resistance)
	were consistently observed. Elastic barriers (with elastic constants
	from 1 to 20 pN/microm and sensitive to cytochalasin D) and small
	nonelastic barriers (<100 nm) were specifically observed with beads
	bound to the GPI-linked Qa-2. We suggest that GPI-linked proteins

	Abstract = {A novel assay based on micropatterning and time-lapse microscopy has
	been developed for the study of nuclear migration dynamics in cultured
	mammalian cells. When cultured on 10-20-microm wide adhesive stripes,
	the motility of C6 glioma and primary mouse fibroblast cells is diminished.
	Nevertheless, nuclei perform an unexpected auto-reverse motion: when
	a migrating nucleus approaches the leading edge, it decelerates,
	changes the direction of motion, and accelerates to move toward the
	other end of the elongated cell. During this process, cells show
	signs of polarization closely following the direction of nuclear
	movement. The observed nuclear movement requires a functioning microtubular
	system, as revealed by experiments disrupting the main cytoskeletal
	components with specific drugs. On the basis of our results, we argue
	that auto-reverse nuclear migration is due to forces determined by
	the interplay of microtubule dynamics and the changing position of
	the microtubule organizing center as the nucleus reaches the leading
	edge. Our assay recapitulates specific features of nuclear migration
	(cell polarization, oscillatory nuclear movement), while it allows
	the systematic study of a large number of individual cells. In particular,
	our experiments yielded the first direct evidence of reversive nuclear

	the event, diffusion coefficients derived from either FRAP or SPT

	cells, differing by a factor of approximately 2, on three different
	timescales: tens of seconds, 1-10 s, and 100 ms. SPT analysis showed
	that the diffusion of most class I MHC molecules was confined on

	of the confined area was 330 nm with a mean residency time of 40s.
	On the alpha-spectrin-deficient MEL cells, the mean diagonal length

	used to confine cell shape within a given geometry. In addition the
	micropattern can be designed so as to impose cells to spread upon
	adhesive and nonadhesive areas. Modulation of the pattern geometry
	allows the analysis of the mechanisms governing the determination
	of cell shape in response to external adhesive conditions. In this
	study, we show that the acquisition of cell shape follows two stages
	where initially the cell forms contact with the micropattern. Here,
	the most distal contacts made by the cell with the micropattern define
	the apices of the cell shape. Then secondly, the cell borders that
	link two apices move so as to minimise the distance between the two
	apices. In these cell borders, the absence of an underlying adhesive
	substrate is overcome by stress fibres forming between the apices,
	which in turn are marked by an accumulation of focal adhesions. By
	inhibiting myosin function, cell borders on nonadhesive zones become
	more concave, suggesting that the stress fibres work against the
	membrane tension in the cell border. Moreover, this suggested that
	traction forces are unevenly distributed in stationary, nonmigrating,
	cells. By comparing the stress fibres in cells with one, two, or
	three nonadherent cell borders it was reasoned that stress fibre
	strength is inversely proportional to number. We conclude that cells
	of a given area can generate the same total sum of tractional forces
	but that these tractional forces are differently spaced depending
	on the spatial distribution of its adherence contacts.},

	Abstract = {Control of the establishment of cell polarity is an essential function
	in tissue morphogenesis and renewal that depends on spatial cues
	provided by the extracellular environment. The molecular role of
	cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts on the establishment
	of cell polarity has been well characterized. It has been hypothesized
	that the geometry of the cell adhesive microenvironment was directing
	cell surface polarization and internal organization. To define how
	the extracellular environment affects cell polarity, we analyzed
	the organization of individual cells plated on defined micropatterned
	substrates imposing cells to spread on various combinations of adhesive
	and nonadhesive areas. The reproducible normalization effect on overall
	cell compartmentalization enabled quantification of the spatial organization
	of the actin network and associated proteins, the spatial distribution
	of microtubules, and the positioning of nucleus, centrosome, and
	Golgi apparatus. By using specific micropatterns and statistical
	analysis of cell compartment positions, we demonstrated that ECM
	geometry determines the orientation of cell polarity axes. The nucleus-centrosome
	orientations were reproducibly directed toward cell adhesive edges.
	The anisotropy of the cell cortex in response to the adhesive conditions
	did not affect the centrosome positioning at the cell centroid. Based
	on the quantification of microtubule plus end distribution we propose
	a working model that accounts for that observation. We conclude that,
	in addition to molecular composition and mechanical properties, ECM
	geometry plays a key role in developmental processes.},

	In addition, a localization algorithm motivated from least-squares

	Abstract = {This paper introduces the method of live-cell multiple-particle-tracking
	microrheology (MPTM), which quantifies the local mechanical properties
	of living cells by monitoring the Brownian motion of individual microinjected
	fluorescent particles. Particle tracking of carboxylated microspheres
	imbedded in the cytoplasm produce spatial distributions of cytoplasmic
	compliances and frequency-dependent viscoelastic moduli. Swiss 3T3
	fibroblasts are found to behave like a stiff elastic material when
	subjected to high rates of deformations and like a soft liquid at
	low rates of deformations. By analyzing the relative contributions
	of the subcellular compliances to the mean compliance, we find that
	the cytoplasm is much more mechanically heterogeneous than reconstituted
	actin filament networks. Carboxylated microspheres embedded in cytoplasm
	through endocytosis and amine-modified polystyrene microspheres,
	which are microinjected or endocytosed, often show directed motion
	and strong nonspecific interactions with cytoplasmic proteins, which
	prevents computation of local moduli from the microsphere displacements.
	Using MPTM, we investigate the mechanical function of alpha-actinin
	in non-muscle cells: alpha-actinin-microinjected cells are stiffer
	and yet mechanically more heterogeneous than control cells, in agreement
	with models of reconstituted cross-linked actin filament networks.

	this remanent field was constant, but for viable macrophages, the
	remanent field decreased rapidly so that only 42% of its initial
	magnitude remained 5 min after alignment. A twisting field was applied
	perpendicular to the direction of alignment and the rate at which
	particles reoriented to this new direction was followed. The same
	twisting was repeated for particles suspended in a series of viscosity
	standards. Based on this approach, the low-shear apparent intracellular

	particles upon magnetization and showed persistent cellular motility
	during randomization of alignment. Cytochalasin D and low temperature
	both reduced cytoplasmic activity and remanent-field decay, but affected
	rheology differently. Magnetic particles were observed in association
	with the microtubule organizing center by immunofluorescence microscopy;
	magnetization did not affect microtubule distribution. However, both
	vimentin intermediate filaments and f-actin reorganized after magnetization.

	Endosome movement, which is normally bidirectional, is completely

	Abstract = {Fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) is becoming the technique of
	choice for analyzing in vivo the dynamics of polymer assemblies,
	such as the cytoskeleton. The massive amount of data produced by
	this method calls for computational approaches to recover the quantities
	of interest; namely, the polymerization and depolymerization activities
	and the motions undergone by the cytoskeleton over time. Attempts
	toward this goal have been hampered by the limited signal-to-noise
	ratio of typical FSM data, by the constant appearance and disappearance
	of speckles due to polymer turnover, and by the presence of flow
	singularities characteristic of many cytoskeletal polymer assemblies.
	To deal with these problems, we present a particle-based method for
	tracking fluorescent speckles in time-lapse FSM image series, based
	on ideas from operational research and graph theory. Our software
	delivers the displacements of thousands of speckles between consecutive
	frames, taking into account that speckles may appear and disappear.
	In this article we exploit this information to recover the speckle
	flow field. First, the software is tested on synthetic data to validate
	our methods. We then apply it to mapping filamentous actin retrograde
	flow at the front edge of migrating newt lung epithelial cells. Our
	results confirm findings from previously published kymograph analyses
	and manual tracking of such FSM data and illustrate the power of
	automated tracking for generating complete and quantitative flow

	protein (GFP). The fusion protein was expressed transiently in Vero
	cells or in a stable clone after induction with butyrate. After arrest

	by fluorometry and metabolic labelling hCgB-GFP was secreted from

	The movement was most active in the central region of the cell near

	Abstract = {The Golgi apparatus comprises an enormous array of components that
	generate its unique architecture and function within cells. Here,
	we use quantitative fluorescence imaging techniques and ultrastructural
	analysis to address whether the Golgi apparatus is a steady-state
	or a stable organelle. We found that all classes of Golgi components
	are dynamically associated with this organelle, contrary to the prediction
	of the stable organelle model. Enzymes and recycling components are
	continuously exiting and reentering the Golgi apparatus by membrane
	trafficking pathways to and from the ER, whereas Golgi matrix proteins
	and coatomer undergo constant, rapid exchange between membrane and
	cytoplasm. When ER to Golgi transport is inhibited without disrupting
	COPII-dependent ER export machinery (by brefeldin A treatment or
	expression of Arf1[T31N]), the Golgi structure disassembles, leaving
	no residual Golgi membranes. Rather, all Golgi components redistribute
	into the ER, the cytoplasm, or to ER exit sites still active for
	recruitment of selective membrane-bound and peripherally associated
	cargos. A similar phenomenon is induced by the constitutively active
	Sar1[H79G] mutant, which has the additional effect of causing COPII-associated
	membranes to cluster to a juxtanuclear region. In cells expressing
	Sar1[T39N], a constitutively inactive form of Sar1 that completely
	disrupts ER exit sites, Golgi glycosylation enzymes, matrix, and
	itinerant proteins all redistribute to the ER. These results argue
	against the hypothesis that the Golgi apparatus contains stable components
	that can serve as a template for its biogenesis. Instead, they suggest
	that the Golgi complex is a dynamic, steady-state system, whose membranes
	can be nucleated and are maintained by the activities of the Sar1-COPII

	comparing the relative intensities of two fluorescent specimens,
	or using advanced techniques like F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer
	(FRET) or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), quantitation
	of fluorescence requires a thorough understanding of the limitations

	Here, I focus on the parameters of digital image acquisition that

	Abstract = {A requirement for understanding morphogenesis is being able to quantify
	expansion at the cellular scale. Here, we present new software (RootflowRT)
	for measuring the expansion profile of a growing root at high spatial
	and temporal resolution. The software implements an image processing
	algorithm using a novel combination of optical flow methods for deformable
	motion. The algorithm operates on a stack of nine images with a given
	time interval between each (usually 10 s) and quantifies velocity
	confidently at most pixels of the image. The root does not need to
	be marked. The software calculates components of motion parallel
	and perpendicular to the local tangent of the root's midline. A variation
	of the software has been developed that reports the overall root
	growth rate versus time. Using this software, we find that the growth
	zone of the root can be divided into two distinct regions, an apical
	region where the rate of motion, i.e. velocity, rises gradually with
	position and a subapical region where velocity rises steeply with
	position. In both zones, velocity increases almost linearly with
	position, and the transition between zones is abrupt. We observed
	this pattern for roots of Arabidopsis, tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum),
	lettuce (Lactuca sativa), alyssum (Aurinia saxatilis), and timothy
	(Phleum pratense). These velocity profiles imply that relative elongation
	rate is regulated in a step-wise fashion, being low but roughly uniform
	within the meristem and then becoming high, but again roughly uniform,
	within the zone of elongation. The executable code for RootflowRT
	is available from the corresponding author on request.},

	is widespread and may allow dynamic regulation, error correction

	evidence suggests that motors for both directions are simultaneously

	so that when plus-end motors are active, minus-end motors are not,

	investigate these properties, we have prepared HLA DR specific monoclonal
	antibodies coupled in a 1:1 mole ratio to the fluorescent phycobiliprotein,
	R-phycoerythrin (PE). We show that these small particles can be sequentially
	imaged using a cooled slow-scan charge coupled device camera and
	hence can be used for single particle tracking experiments. We have
	applied this technique to investigate the movements of HLA DR molecules
	on fibroblasts transfected with human DR alpha and DR beta genes.
	PE-IgG was bound to the transfected fibroblasts and particle tracks
	were obtained by sequential imaging over a period of typically 30
	minutes. Analysis of particle tracks revealed the presence of directed
	motion and domain-limited diffusion in addition to random diffusion.
	The contributions of these three types of motion showed cell to cell
	variability. Velocities of directed motion were of the order of 2
	nm second-1 whilst domain diameters were in the range 200-800 nm.
	Diffusion coefficients for random diffusion were in the range 1 x
	10(-13)-5 x 10(-12) cm2 second-1. The higher mobilities were observed
	for the lower intensity fluorescent spots, which possibly correspond
	to images of single particles. Much lower mobility was observed with

	Consistent with nonproteolytic migration, T-cell crawling and path
	generation were not impaired by protease inhibitor cocktail targeting

	on self-assembly and replica molding for carrying out micro- and
	nanofabrication. It provides a convenient, effective, and low-cost
	method for the formation and manufacturing of micro- and nanostructures.
	In soft lithography, an elastomeric stamp with patterned relief structures
	on its surface is used to generate patterns and structures with feature
	sizes ranging from 30 nm to 100 mu m. Five techniques have been demonstrated:
	microcontact printing (mu CP), replica molding (REM), microtransfer
	molding (mu TM), micromolding in capillaries (MIMIC), and solvent-assisted
	micromolding (SAMIM). In this chapter we discuss the procedures for
	these techniques and their applications in micro- and nanofabrication,
	surface chemistry, materials science, optics, MEMS, and microelectronics.},

	of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ligand. Instead, truncation
	of the alpha4 cytoplasmic domain caused a severe deficiency in integrin

	decreased the membrane diffusivity of alpha4beta1, as determined

@article{Zhou2000,
	Abstract = {An early event of beta(2) integrin activation is the increased diffusion
	rate of this molecule on the cell surface, thereby providing integrin
	molecules with a better chance to meet the ligands. The activation
	of protein kinase C (PKC) stimulates integrin diffusion by releasing
	the cytoskeletal constraint on integrin molecules. We report here
	that macrophage-enriched myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate
	(MacMARCKS), a membrane-associated PKC substrate involved in integrin
	activation, is required for this PKC-stimulated diffusion of integrin
	molecules. Using the single-particle tracking technique, we observed
	that the activation of PKC stimulated an 11-fold increase in the
	diffusion rate of beta(2) integrins in wild type J774 macrophage
	cells but not in those expressing mutant MacMARCKS. Further evidence
	is provided from a MacMARCKS-deficient cell line in which phorbol
	esters failed to stimulate the diffusion of integrin. Transfection
	of wild type MacMARCKS into these cells restored the rapid diffusion
	rate of the beta(2) integrins. The phosphorylation of MacMARCKS is
	important because transfection of a nonphosphorylatable MacMARCKS
	mutant or the addition of staurosporine eliminates the rapid diffusion
	rate of integrin. Furthermore, adding cytochalasin D bypasses the
	MacMARCKS deficiency and stimulates beta(2) integrin diffusion, suggesting
	that MacMARCKS's involvement in integrin activation is prior or at
	the site of cytoskeleton. Therefore, we conclude that MacMARCKS is

	Abstract = {Muscle contraction is usually measured and characterized with force
	and displacement transducers. The contraction of muscle fibers, however,
	evokes in the tissue a two and even three-dimensional displacement
	field, which is not properly quantified by these transducers because
	they provide just a single scalar quantity. This problem can be circumvented
	by using optical measurements and standard tools of computer vision,
	developed for the analysis of time varying image sequences. By computing
	the so called optical flow, i.e. the apparent motion of points in
	a time varying image sequence, it is possible to recover a two-dimensional
	motion field, describing rather precisely the displacement caused
	by muscle contraction in a flattened piece of skin. The obtained
	two-dimensional optical flow can be further analyzed by computing
	its elementary deformation components, providing a novel and accurate
	characterization of the contraction induced by different motoneurons.
	This technique is demonstrated analyzing the displacement caused
	by muscle contraction in the skin of the leech, Hirudo medicinalis.
	The proposed technique can be applied to monitor and characterize
	all contractions in almost flat tissues with enough visual texture.},

@article{Zoccolan2002,
	Abstract = {The nervous system of the leech is a particularly suitable model to
	investigate neural coding of sensorimotor responses because it allows
	both observation of behavior and the simultaneous measurement of
	a large fraction of its underlying neuronal activity. In this study,
	we used a combination of multielectrode recordings, videomicroscopy,
	and computation of the optical flow to investigate the reproducibility
	of the motor response caused by local mechanical stimulation of the
	leech skin. We analyzed variability at different levels of processing:
	mechanosensory neurons, motoneurons, muscle activation, and behavior.
	Spike trains in mechanosensory neurons were very reproducible, unlike
	those in motoneurons. The motor response, however, was reproducible
	because of two distinct biophysical mechanisms. First, leech muscles
	contract slowly and therefore are poorly sensitive to the jitter
	of motoneuron spikes. Second, the motor response results from the
	coactivation of a population of motoneurons firing in a statistically
	independent way, which reduces the variability of the population
	firing. These data show that reproducible spike trains are not required
	to sustain reproducible behaviors and illustrate how the nervous
	system can cope with unreliable components to produce reliable action.},

@article{Zoccolan2002a,
	Abstract = {Activation of motoneurons innervating leech muscles causes the appearance
	of a two-dimensional vector field of deformations on the skin surface
	that can be fully characterized using a new technique (Zoccolan et
	al., 2001) based on the computation of the optical flow, the two-dimensional
	vector field describing the point displacements on the skin. These
	vector fields are characterized by their origin (i.e., the singular
	point) and by four elementary components that combine linearly: expansion
	(or compression), rotation, longitudinal shear, and oblique shear.
	All motoneurons can be classified and recognized according to the
	components of the deformations they elicit: longitudinal motoneurons
	give rise almost exclusively to longitudinal negative shear, whereas
	circular motoneurons give rise to both positive longitudinal shear
	and significant negative expansion. Oblique motoneurons induce strong
	oblique shear, in addition to longitudinal shear and negative expansion.
	Vector fields induced by the contraction of longitudinal, circular,
	and oblique fibers superimpose linearly. Skin deformations can therefore
	be attributed rather reliably to the contraction of distinct longitudinal,
	circular, and oblique muscle fibers. We compared the deformation
	patterns produced by touching the skin with those produced by intracellular
	stimulation of P, T, and N cells: vector fields resulting from the
	activation of P cells were almost identical to those produced by
	mechanical stimulation. Therefore, motor responses triggered by light
	or moderate touch are almost entirely mediated by excitation of P
	cells, with minor contributions from T and N cells.},
